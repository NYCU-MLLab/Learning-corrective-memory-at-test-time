His investigation was n't entirely fruitless , he discovered a mostly full bottle of vodka . It was cheap but would definitely get the job done . Taking a few swigs made it childishly easy to ignore that gigantic black cloud of fog blotting out whatever the hell he did before he woke up . <newline> There was a mirror in the room and for want of anything more interesting to study he gazed at himself . It was a game he 'd play with himself , glancing at the mirror and seeing if he could recognize the person looking back . If he did n't know better he 'd have guessed he was a very successful mattress salesman , or perhaps a bum who had managed to score some luck gambling . <newline> His face was portly and unshaven , in that limbo place where it had been too many days without being clean and too few days to become a beard . His stomach was round but firm , like a basketball stuffed under a shirt and then semi deflated . The hair was long and unruly , receding far into the past . But his eyes were the giveaway . Looking closely enough at them he could still see an intensity . It was n't the sharp kind he carried in his youth but rather like a rusted dagger . Still sharp enough to cut . <newline> `` DiCaprio . '' The curse rasped out of him in a choke . After all these years spent working on the hallmark channel and tv series based on mediocre movies he was still there . Despite his best efforts to bury himself under all of the alchol and drugs he was still in there . He thought for sure after the bankruptcy he 'd be done , but no that god damned rerelease of Titanic the royalties started pouring in and he could n't get rid of the money . Not even the live action version of the nut job could destroy him . <newline> Cursing he hurled the bottle at the mirror but his wet hands slipped and instead of a shattering crash there was only a thud as the bottle bounced off the dry wall and rolled on the floor . <newline> His rage thwarted by his impotence he slumped against the floor and finally noticed why there was rain coming into this room . <newline> <newline> The window was smashed . He looked at the bottle , confused . No , he had n't done that . At least not with the vodka . He looked back at the glass etched around the window sill and his eyes hung on the red that stained the jagged teeth . <newline> <newline> The headache crept back towards the front of his mind while the bloody glass pinned his eyes in place . What the fuck happened last night ?"}
