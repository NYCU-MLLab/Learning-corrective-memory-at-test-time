A short long haired woman with pointy ears and a white robe is yelling at me . <newline> <newline> `` Into the fray NoobPoner657 , the Alliance needs you ! '' <newline> <newline> I 've been revived . Again and again they bring me back , and every time I die . I ca n't remember the order of the deaths but they sit there in my mind . A wolf tearing out my guts as I scream in pain . A bolt of lightning arcing from the sky electrocuting me . Always surrounded by enemies , always dying . <newline> <newline> I must get out of here , away from this endless cycle . I turn away from the battle looking for my escape , but I can not move . <newline> <newline> The voice has returned . It never truly leaves . I feel my feet guiding me back towards the battle . I try to stop as I have a thousand times before but it is no use . The voice carries me forward . I can hear it muttering in the back of my mind in a strange language *That guy is so op since the last patch , its fucking stupid . * I know not what the words mean , yet they send a shiver down my spine . <newline> <newline> I long for the days spent doing heroic tasks for my homeland . When I collected 15 boar tusks for Edelon 's new house in the Forest of Talleron . When I defeated the evil ice witch of the Resson Tundra . Heroic deeds for people who need help . Instead I am dragged to and from death in this endless bloodbath . There is no end . <newline> <newline> I plunge into the fray with the fury of one who can do nothing else . <newline> <newline> <newline>"}

'' and then those dressed in knock off Yeezy ( as none could afford the actual brand and no one can tell the difference from garage sale distressed 90s grunge wear ) begin to push back , arguments and tempers flare across the room . <newline> <newline> Taylor bites her lip , takes her mic off the stand and heads toward center stage . `` The haters gon na hate , hate , hate , hate , hate -- '' she starts to go in to her hit , the sound guy takes cue and sets the music playing . <newline> <newline> For a moment , the crowd looks over , and the Taylor fans cheer , but this only angers the Kanye crew . <newline> <newline> Jaden knew what must be done . <newline> <newline> Without a word , he heads back stage . `` Kanye , '' he calls out . A shadow stands in a bright doorway , the rear exit off the studio . The name echoes down the hall . <newline> <newline> `` Will you hate ? Or for this country 's sake , can you shake ? '' Jaden 's silver make up and chrome skirt reminded Kanye of early 2000s TLC and Destiny 's Child , a Beyonce that inspired him . <newline> <newline> The roar of the crowd reached Kanye 's ears . <newline> <newline> `` Only you can improve this situation , '' Jaden said . <newline> <newline> `` I will freestyle the next verse , '' he agreed , and headed back toward the stage . <newline> <newline> When the crowd saw him , the Taylor fans shrieked in anger , their white faces turning red from madness . The Kanye fans were invigorated . The whole place was prepared for a riot . <newline> <newline> Taylor sang the chorus with heart and soul , then , tossed Kanye the microphone . He began to rap . <newline> <newline> The fans , moved by Taylor 's gesture , the beat , the chorus , began to feel the music . Cries of , `` let 's dance , let 's stop fighting ! '' were heard across the room . <newline> <newline> His words captured the spirit of Taylor 's work , spinning them in to a form palatable to the tastes of his fans . A new appreciation for pop , elevated by their hip hop god , took root in their minds , and they , too , began to shake . <newline> <newline> Soon , everyone was dancing . The riot had been averted . <newline> <newline> Jaden took the podium once more . `` Who says we ca n't have two presidents ? '' <newline> <newline> The crowd cheered ."}

I 'm always worried that I 'll be cumbersome while I help someone , so I tend to ignore the needs of others . It 's something that I 'm actively working on , and one of my main inspirations for improving my speed of assistance comes from this story that happened to me . <newline> <newline> I lived in Hong Kong back when I was a kid - out in the New Territories ( the 'rural ' area ) , and would take the bus home from school . The public transportation was and still is fantastic , so I was alone when I rode the double decker bus back home . When I got to the nearest station to my home , I began to walk towards the subway tunnel , which led to the pathway to my house . The path to my house was under this long canopy of trees , and was squeezed into a thin lane between the trees and a wall right behind the trees - basically you could only walk on this path . The path extended past this sort of village place , then went on towards a cul-de-sac . The cul-de-sac was where I lived , and took about an hour to get to . It was a long but nice walk . <newline> <newline> Unfortunately there were a lot of wild dogs around that area , and I had an almost pathological fear of dogs ( I think I was bitten by one when I was really young and I kept that fear ) . At that moment in time though I only ever heard the dogs ' barks ; at that moment I had never seen a wild dog . Today though , I spotted a dog lying on the pathway in front of me . First reaction was to be quiet and just step over it , since I did n't have enough space to go around . But when I actually got to the point of doing the act , I stopped . It was probably smarter to just wait for the dog to wake up and leave . So I turned around and began to walk back . But then I heard growling behind me . <newline> <newline> Somehow I had woken up the dog ( I think I stepped on it 's tail by accident ) , and it was mad at me . So , faced with the danger of being bitten , and with faded memories of other encounters with dogs rising up , I chose flight and began to run . Of course , my stubby legs could n't outrun the fully grown dog , and it caught up to me quickly . Realising the situation I was in , I decided to turn around and fight the dog . So I promptly tried to punch its nose with my right hand , but instead got it caught in the dog 's mouth . Fear of the dog was n't ruling me anymore , and I bit the dog back . Dog whimpers and runs away , but leaves me with a bleeding hand - and the possibility of a disease . It also hurt a lot and I was still an hour away from home .

I was an expat 's child though and did n't understand . She then dropped her little trolley , and lifted me up in both of her arms . She stuttered out the words , `` Come with me , I have bandaids . '' I just nodded and let myself be carried off down the pathway . She lived in the village that the path passed by , and so only took a minute or so to reach .

{"text": "You just started a new job in a large office building and what you do n't know is that at twelve o'clock every day , there is a office wide Purge style battle to the death , those who survive an hour get a significant pay raise and can come back tomorrow . A bell just went off , it 's twelve o'clock . As I finished up my research on Alligator breeding habits for a story I was tasked with writing , a bell began to ring loudly throughout the office . I could feel the sound vibrating off the cubicle walls . I looked over my cubicle wall to ask a co-worker what the bell was for . <newline> <newline> I watched as he calmly opened his desk drawer , to reveal a small armory . There were multiple handguns , knives and magazines and other assorted weapons neatly stashed away . <newline> <newline> `` What the hell is that for ?

I saw my life flash before my eyes , and could n't understand what circumstances had arisen to put me in this position .

{"text": "It is believed that the cure for cancer has been discovered on Mars , astronauts have only one chance to bring it home where they hope to duplicate its properties for mass distribution `` Dr. Edmunds , something interesting came up on the latest screen , '' stated Johannes , the tremor in his voice betraying a cautious optimism . <newline> <newline> `` This better be good . My grant proposal is due Friday , '' stated Edmunds , finally tearing her gaze away from the monitor and to Johannes . He quickly glanced at the ground , concealing his surprise . Edmunds appeared more pale and gaunt than usual . His face started to burn . Hardly anyone dared to enter Edmund 's office without scheduling an appointment . Luckily , Johannes ' appearance was bold enough to warrant her undivided attention . She noticed he was in an unusual state of disarray , hair greasy and biosafety suit wrinkled . He must have been working double shifts . <newline> <newline> `` I-If this is what I think it is , you 'll have every big pharma company coming to *you* with the money , '' Johannes replied . `` I repeated this experiment three times , always in triplicates . Data is statistically significant at a *p* of 0.0001 . In other words , there is a 0.01 % chance that it is due to random variation , and -- '' <newline> <newline> `` Let me see , '' she interrupted . Johannes passed her the sheets of data . Edmunds sat up straighter and leaned forward , brows knit in inquisitive concern as her eyes darted across the numbers . <newline> <newline> Sample 1215 : at long last , a positive hit . <newline> <newline> A rare smile slowly crept unto Edmund 's face , then suddenly burst into an ear-to-ear grin . Eyes shining , she said , `` We spent five years at the edge of this colony , hoping in vain to find some new compound as a therapeutic agent to combat the cancer on Earth ... . '' here , a hand flitted across her chest and rested across her heart . She coughed violently , spasms rocking her thin body as another hand covered her mouth . Pulling away , spots of blood were seen . She hastily wiped her hand off on a handkerchief . There were n't many unstained areas left on the fabric . The familiar dull throbbing pain returned to her chest . <newline> <newline> Johannes offered her water , which she gratefully sipped . After a pause , she continued . `` We took a risk being here . They said we could n't find anything by the mines . But that ended up being our advantage . What was Sample 1215 ? '' <newline> <newline> Johannes could no longer contain his once cautious excitement . `` Sample 1215 was one of few organic compounds found from the soil dug up in the mines . There is life down there , likely bacterial in origin , and it is producing this compound in great quantities . Mass spec data revealed a unique peptide sequence found nowhere on Earth , though there is some homology to *Micromonospora* soil bacterial proteins , '' he paused to take a breath -- oxygen content is lower inside the Mars facility compared to Earth . `` When given to cancer cells *in vitro* , it killed nearly all of them while not harming non-cancerous cells . In the animal model , this compound appears to stop angiogenesis . In other words , in addition to its cancer-specific cytotoxicity , it prevents blood vessel growth to the tumor . '' <newline> <newline> Edmunds slowly stood , smile unwavering . `` You have made a remarkable discovery , Johannes . You will finally be able to graduate with your Ph.D. , with nothing less than the highest honors . '' <newline> <newline> `` Thank you , Dr. Edmunds . Without your direction , this would n't have been possible , '' Johannes replied , bowing his head . A shadow crept over his face . There was a hesitating silence before he continued . `` I ... I knew about your condition all along . The cancer you tried to keep secret . The same cancer afflicting most of the population on Earth . The way you are now ... .There is n't much time . '' <newline> <newline> Edmunds nodded slowly in agreement . It was foolish of her to think the others would n't have noticed by now . <newline> <newline> `` I can give you the first treatment , '' Johannes said , looking up to meet Edmunds ' eyes . `` It might give you more time . Enough to see that we take it home over the years . '' <newline> <newline> Her eyes looked past Johannes towards the window , beyond the red terrain and into the sky . `` Yes , I would like that very much . But that ca n't be the focus now . I did n't tell anyone this , but there 's only going to be one more trip from the Colony to go home . Back on Earth , people have given up so much hope that they do n't want to allocate anymore resources to us . The grant I have been writing was for a separate project that can be done on Earth . '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? ! '' Johannes blurted loudly . `` There is only one chance to take home a cure we only discovered this month ? For all of the people affected on Earth ? How can we manage that ? '' <newline> <newline> Edmunds sighed . The weariness she felt was not only physical . `` What we will do is find the organism producing Compound 1215 , and find out the conditions it best grows in . Then , we will see if we can mimic those conditions on Earth . If we can grow the bacteria on Earth , we can produce", "prompt": "It is believed that the cure for cancer has been discovered on Mars , astronauts have only one chance to bring it home where they hope to duplicate its properties for mass distribution", "target": "`` Dr. Edmunds , something interesting came up on the latest screen , '' stated Johannes , the tremor in his voice betraying a cautious optimism . <newline> <newline> `` This better be good . My grant proposal is due Friday , '' stated Edmunds , finally tearing her gaze away from the monitor and to Johannes . He quickly glanced at the ground , concealing his surprise . Edmunds appeared more pale and gaunt than usual . His face started to burn . Hardly anyone dared to enter Edmund 's office without scheduling an appointment . Luckily , Johannes ' appearance was bold enough to warrant her undivided attention . She noticed he was in an unusual state of disarray , hair greasy and biosafety suit wrinkled . He must have been working double shifts . <newline> <newline> `` I-If this is what I think it is , you 'll have every big pharma company coming to *you* with the money , '' Johannes replied . `` I repeated this experiment three times , always in triplicates . Data is statistically significant at a *p* of 0.0001 . In other words , there is a 0.01 % chance that it is due to random variation , and -- '' <newline> <newline> `` Let me see , '' she interrupted . Johannes passed her the sheets of data . Edmunds sat up straighter and leaned forward , brows knit in inquisitive concern as her eyes darted across the numbers . <newline> <newline> Sample 1215 : at long last , a positive hit . <newline> <newline> A rare smile slowly crept unto Edmund 's face , then suddenly burst into an ear-to-ear grin . Eyes shining , she said , `` We spent five years at the edge of this colony , hoping in vain to find some new compound as a therapeutic agent to combat the cancer on Earth ... . '' here , a hand flitted across her chest and rested across her heart . She coughed violently , spasms rocking her thin body as another hand covered her mouth . Pulling away , spots of blood were seen . She hastily wiped her hand off on a handkerchief . There were n't many unstained areas left on the fabric . The familiar dull throbbing pain returned to her chest . <newline> <newline> Johannes offered her water , which she gratefully sipped . After a pause , she continued . `` We took a risk being here . They said we could n't find anything by the mines . But that ended up being our advantage . What was Sample 1215 ? '' <newline> <newline> Johannes could no longer contain his once cautious excitement . `` Sample 1215 was one of few organic compounds found from the soil dug up in the mines . There is life down there , likely bacterial in origin , and it is producing this compound in great quantities . Mass spec data revealed a unique peptide sequence found nowhere on Earth , though there is some homology to *Micromonospora* soil bacterial proteins , '' he paused to take a breath -- oxygen content is lower inside the Mars facility compared to Earth . `` When given to cancer cells *in vitro* , it killed nearly all of them while not harming non-cancerous cells . In the animal model , this compound appears to stop angiogenesis . In other words , in addition to its cancer-specific cytotoxicity , it prevents blood vessel growth to the tumor . '' <newline> <newline> Edmunds slowly stood , smile unwavering . `` You have made a remarkable discovery , Johannes .
