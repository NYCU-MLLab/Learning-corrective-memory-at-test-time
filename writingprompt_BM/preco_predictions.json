    "target": "It just happened one night . I woke up at 7 to get ready for work just like any other day . I checked my emails , no new one since I checked the night before . I hope in the shower , listen to Pandora , and head to the kitchen to eat some breakfast . I head out to my car to head to work when I start to notice something different . <newline> <newline> One of my neighbors was standing outside his car , looking puzzled at a map spread across the hood of his car . I start to drive to work , and see a few cars pulled over with more people looking at maps . I checked my phone to see if I have any emails again , however there still was none . This was extremely odd as I know my colleagues get in a hour before me to straighten out any issues that arose overnight , which they were supposed to send me an update 15 minutes ago . <newline> <newline> I pull into my parking spot and notice a few empty spots near me . I walk into the office , but I see complete chaos . The receptionist is running across offices , the IT team is working on the main computers , mainly the ones directly attached to the internet . I walk up to Red , our head IT , and ask him what is going on ? <newline> <newline> Red looks up at me when he answers , `` Internet 's been down all morning . We are trying to get it back on . '' He looks back down at the computer and exclaims , `` Hey guys , I have internet over here ! '' <newline> <newline> Half the office comes running to Red , almost knocking him over to get access to the internet . I back away , heading over to my office on the other side of the building . `` No ! It 's already gone ! '' I hear from behind me . <newline> <newline> I get to my desk and see that my internet is working fine . I send a few emails from yesterday that I never got to , and let my assistant , Carol , know that if she needs to use the internet , it seems to be working in my office . She walks in with her laptop and is shocked by that fact . `` The internet is down everywhere , '' Carol says , `` I almost did n't get to work on time today because my normal alarm clock is on my computer through the internet . Thank goodness my husband still believes in analog clocks to wake him up , or else I would be in the same boat as everyone that is n't here yet . '' <newline> <newline> '' That 's really weird , '' I say , scratching my chin . `` I had internet all morning . '' <newline> <newline> '' Maybe you 're just lucky . You 've turned into your own hot spot , '' She joked . <newline> <newline> I continue my work , but ca n't help but look online as to what is going on , but I notice nothing has been updated since yesterday , and by nothing , I mean nothing . No news , no Facebook , not even Reddit has had any action . <newline> <newline> '' Carol , '' I ask , `` Can you get the TV from the break room and bring it in here ? I want to see what the news says about this internet problem . '' <newline> <newline> '' No problem boss ! '' She said , getting out of under her laptop and walking out of the office . A few minutes later , she wheels in the TV , but has a couple other people following her in , carrying their own laptops . <newline> <newline> '' Hey boss , I have the TV , but a few people in other departments need to access the internet as well . Do you mind if they stay ? '' <newline> <newline> '' Not at all , '' I said , `` As long as I can hear the news , you can use the internet all you want . '' <newline> <newline> Carol turns the TV on for me , switching it to channel 5 . The news is in the middle of the weather , so I check my email again , still nothing . The news transfers back to the main anchors . <newline> <newline> '' For those of you just tuning in , there is a global internet outage . Specialists across the globe are currently working on diagnosing the problem , however if anyone has any internet access , please contact the Department of Homeland Security at the number listed below . '' <newline> <newline> I did n't understand why Homeland Security would be involved with this , but I guess they want internet just as much as the next guy . <newline> <newline> '' Hey , '' said one of the temps who came into the office , `` We should call that number . Maybe they will figure out why this office has internet and no where else does ! '' <newline> <newline> '' Hey kid , '' I say , `` Do you want to continue working in this building or do you want the government to come in here , kick us out of our own company , and use our internet access for themselves ? Because as soon as we say we have access , they will come here and use the web as if they worked in the building from the start . '' I stare into his eyes and say , `` Get whatever you need on the"

Truly a spiritual experience . However after I had downed a buffalo that had fallen behind the herd I had a life changing dining experience . While gnawing at the beast 's neck I heard movement but a few feet behind me . I quickly turned my head but there was nothing there . <newline> <newline> To be safe I crawled towards the source of the noise . There was nothing to be found responsible for the noise . `` Must be a scavenger , a raccoon , trying to steal my buffalo . Better return to my dinner '' I thought to myself . But the tracks left on the ground were not that of a raccoon . They were shoes . Basketball shoes . In the center of the tracks were a symbol . It resembled that of a man making a slam dunk . `` No . It ca n't be '' I thought to myself with dread . <newline> <newline> I continued following the tracks left by the culprit . I reached a revine . Across the revine was a sight that I did n't believe . `` My . God . '' I said to myself . A giant copy of Space Jam 2 . I thought I 'd never seen one in person . On the cover was Bugs Bunny standing back to back with famous basketball player ... Yao Ming ... `` Why ... .. why not Lebron ? Why not anyone else ? '' <newline> <newline> I pulled my phone form my butthole , where I kept all of my supplies while I lived in the woods , and took a snapshot of the movie . But alas , it was blurry . The camera was covered in poop . So I quickly wiped off the poop and took another picture . But the sight was n't the same . It was still pretty blurry because I did n't wipe all the poop off so I wiped the camera against my bare skin to smear the poop off . I tried to take the photo one more time but my phone ran out of battery . Dammit . The movie ran off and I never saw it again ."

He pulled the strings tied to the flaps sending them up to further reduce his speed . <newline> <newline> He was still coming in too fast , the ground rushed to meet his small rubber wheels . John refused to close his eyes , he wanted to remember every second of this landing . With a thundering impact the plane 's wheels touched the ground , instantly blowing them out . Twisted , torn rubber sprayed behind the airplane as it bounced off of the ground and landed on metal rims . John 's teeth were nearly rattling out of his head as the plane bounced precariously down the runway . His grip was so tight on the stick he felt like he was going to break it in half . The tail swung left as the plane began to spin . Reflexively John shut his eyes and prayed . <newline> <newline> The plane dipped and a wing was torn off by the impact with the ground .

The commander was about to give the order to launch the boulders , but there was no way they would let one of their own men be catapulted on the walls of an enemy castle . Seeing how low the morale was , the commander had to be more careful than usual with his men in this land away from France fighting so *le petit* Louis could win a pretty crown to wear on his noble head . <newline> <newline> So , the commander cursed at these two men while he waited for them to be able continue their duty . Once they were ready , he gave the signal , and the boulders came crashing down on the castle walls . <newline> <newline> In time , they did breach the wall , and the English had to retreat to the inner walls of the fortress . In a completely unexpected turn of event , they ended up tunneling their way out and attacking from behind . Thus , Louis , the Dauphin de France , lost what was later known as the First Barons ' War ."

    "target": "The cool mountain air carried the scent of danger . Thand breathed deeply of the rich scent of the forest . He was alone , a rare privilege these days . As the scion of one of the five Xopa houses , and highest ranking Xopa commander in the Imperial army , his soldiers and servants always surrounded him . He knew some of the humans under his command mocked him for keeping to the old ways of his people . He snorted to himself as he thought of the puny humans and their torches , horses , guns , and dogs . No , the true test of the warrior was to face the darkness alone . <newline> <newline> Alone in the dark , Thand drew strength from the forest . Some of the Xopa raiders captured earlier that day had cursed him as a rastilneta , the slur free Xopa used to describe their brethren who had joined the empire . Let those starving wretches call him a potted plant when he hunted alone tonight with only his blade , he thought to himself . <newline> <newline> Somewhere in the darkness ahead , under the cold light of the moon , a panther screamed . Thand ’ s blood chilled at the sound as he instinctively moved toward it . His prey was a predator herself , and he silently congratulated her on her kill . He prayed to be so lucky when he would find her . His eyes were already adjusting to the darkness , and his other senses conveyed so much more of what the woods would say . He pitied his human comrades who would never know the secrets of the forest . <newline> <newline> Despite Thand ’ s heightened senses , it was the whistling that alerted him to their presence . He instinctively dropped into the fighting stance taught to him by his teachers . As the son of a sinjoro , he had of course been taught to fight in the Imperial style , although his father had demanded that he and his brothers learn the old ways as well . The result had been a very peculiar blend of old and new that made Thand one of the most formidable fighters in the empire . <newline> <newline> The whistling intensified as a dozen Xopa warriors emerged from the trees in a rough circle around him . In the darkness their chestnut skin and rich green braids blended well with the woods . <newline> <newline> Look , a lost little rastilneta one mocked him . <newline> <newline> All alone without any men or guns to protect him another said . <newline> <newline> The speech of the Xopa sounded like the rustle of the wind through leaves , and carried the unmistakable lilt of laughter . Stepping forward into the clearing , Thand could see that they were lean , wiry and ropy , despite being nearly nine feet tall . They were naked except for loincloths , although the leader was wearing a pouched vest as well . Their simple costumes were in sharp contrast to Thand ’ s attire . <newline> <newline> Dressed in the blue and butternut of the Imperial Army of Ortinia , with his brown leather boots , Thand looked ridiculous . As Xopa were almost one and a half times the size of a man , his tunic and pants were large and loose . At his hip he reached reflexively for his holster , only to remember that he had left it behind . The only weapon he had with him was his traditional scimitar . <newline> <newline> Are you ready to die , rastilneta ? another taunted him , as the circle feinted in and out around him . <newline> <newline> Thand stoop up , revealing his impressive ten-foot height . “ I am Thandizwe sin Arakwe . My father was Galza sin Arakwe . His father was Syabu Doxar sin Arakwe . I can trace my ancestry back to Mizuxi himself . You are nothing but bandits and beggars , ” he said with a well-earned arrogance . He undid the brass buttons and shrugged off his tunic . <newline> <newline> The moonlight revealed his beautiful , scarred body . There were marks from the fights his father had demanded of him , from the duels he had fought on his long rise to power , and from his many battles for the Ortinians . He hefted the sabre as he stared at the leader . <newline> <newline> “ This blade was made in the old way , from the stinger of the giant daggerwasp . I killed the queen and drank her dream honey myself . I blooded this blade when I was but eight summers old , on raider scum just like you , ” Thand growled . His eyes flicked from warrior to warrior . Thand knew he was outnumbered twelve to one . He had to draw them in . <newline> <newline> “ When I kill you , I will burn your bodies . I will throw the ashes into the great salt . Your seed will shrivel up and die . Your spirits will be condemned to howl in the wastes for all eternity. ” This last insult finally proved too much and one warrior charged him with a fierce cry . <newline> <newline> Thand ’ s scimitar met his attacker in the throat , spilling his rich sweet blood on the pine needles . As the warrior ’ s momentum carried him forward , Thand buried his blade in the xopa ’ s back . The warrior ’ s lifeless body collapsed to the floor . A new respect appeared in the eyes of the leader and the older veterans . A growing fear warred behind the eyes of some of the younger warriors .

Alas Melissa did n't remember their encounter because of her friend Captain Morgan . She instead believed the baby 's father to be Blaine , an Aboriginal bodybuilder . Melissa had spent the best part of her pregnancy in the fear that her baby would end up black .

Even the hot cauldron of coffee that laid perilously next to the impossibly high stack of papers on his desk was n't helping . <newline> <newline> `` This stupid test is tomorrow and I have n't learned a damn thing , '' he said , nobody in the room to actually hear it .

The shapes started blurry but got clearer , bolder , brighter . The peach-colored malaise became flesh and bone , and a woman sitting high above the sky in her glaring silver cylinder became apparent . She had short , brownish tassels of hair poking through her brown , weathered cap , her slender face filled with confidence as she took the controls , preparing for a safe , steady landing . <newline> <newline> `` Itsaca to Earhart , Itasca to Earhart , do you read me ?

The plane landed effortlessly on this patch of matted dirt , slowed to a crawl and finally became stationary . The engine 's continuous but dull roar started to sputter before finally giving way to the crashing of waves on the beach and the gulls that would occasionally chirp out . <newline> <newline> Amelia lifted the armrest up before turning towards the side to get up , the blood still not quite back in her legs after a 6 hour flight . She opened the door , and instantly the air retaliated , the Sun pelting her with a heat and the ocean pelting her with a dampness that together made one feel like they had just been airdropped into a sauna . <newline> <newline> She pulled out her map from the leather jacket that she 'd worn , a trusty companion that had been with her from Miami to Macau . <newline> <newline> `` This should be Itsacatown , '' she said , a certain questioning tone coming over her voice . This was the right place , but something about the air made it feel a little too still . She walked over to the town , it being no more than 300 feet from the godforsaken airstrip she 'd just landed on . Peering around , poking around , the stillness became even more apparent . <newline> <newline> Amelia looked in the tiny , corrugated steel service station . Nobody was there . <newline> <newline> Amelia looked in the weathered , creaky wooden homes that were bunched together like a bundle of sticks . Nobody was there . <newline> <newline> Amelia looked in the watering hole , the cups still sitting on the bar , filled no doubt with the strongest of whisky . Nobody was there . <newline> <newline> She walked around town again and again and again , hoping to find a soul . She was unsuccessful . Finally , in despair , tired , with no fuel , and with the backdrop of the Sun 's white glow turning into a pinkish-orangish beacon over the western sky , she turned in for the night at the local inn . However , there too , she found nobody . <newline> <newline> She went upstairs , the floors squeaking . All the rooms were empty , but she found one that looked like nobody had actually been in there in a while . Taking off her black flying boots , her gloves , and resigning herself to the bed with its yellowed sheets and dusty pillows , she started to drift off , knowing tomorrow , she 'd fly again . <newline> <newline> The morning sun came belting through the windows , almost as if the sunlight was being quite literally thrown into the room ."

It had n't been this tense in the place since The New Laws were passed . <newline> <newline> Every eye he had met was wide , every conversation he had had was hushed , even if it was about the most mundane thing .

And also for no apparent reason I was the object of constant harassment and ridicule . I was especially made fun of by the girls who thought it was uncool to not have a boyfriend ... at age 13 . So to shut them up , and at least attempt to get the guys off my back , I made up a boyfriend . He was the image of the perfect boy , in my mind . <newline> <newline> I had everything made up for him , what his birthday was , what his parents were like , how his childhood was , etc . It started out small , I 'd only bring him up when the girls would brag about their boyfriends . But then I 'd start to talk to him , tell him about my day . At the time I was n't very close to my mom , teenage angst and whatnot , so I had no one to talk to about my bullying problem . And I took it like it did n't hurt . My imaginary friend was my only escape . <newline> <newline> I 'm in college now , been quite a few years since I last ever talked to my imaginary friend .

And yet ... <newline> <newline> It was any other day at school , just walking towards my one class , not really paying attention to what was happening in front of me . I run right smack into someone . Typical , like my mom would always tell me `` If there 's ever a way for you to get hurt , you will '' . The person I hit was tall , being a short person makes everyone tall , but he was about a foot taller than me . I rubbed my nose . `` Ouch . I am so sorry .

After a minute I shook my head , `` I 'm sorry for staring , you are just really freaking good looking . '' I 'm blunt , always have been , ca n't help it . <newline> <newline> The guy laughed , `` You sound just like my one old childhood friend . She 'd always say freaking instead of cursing .

Is that a nickname for Jacob ? '' That 's what it usually was . <newline> <newline> `` Nope , just Jake . My mom thought it was cool , and that -- '' <newline> <newline> `` Jacob was lame ? '' I finished his sentence . That 's what I had imagined Jake 's mom had said when she picked out his name . No way , that 'd be impossible . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah ... lucky guess . '' He said with a smirk . The same smirk Jake would give me when he would be sarcastic . `` So what 's your name ? '' Jake asked as he motioned for me to walk with him . <newline> <newline> `` Gina . '' I answered , and he stopped walking for a second . <newline> <newline> Another nervous laugh , `` That 's funny , that 's the same name as my old friend , the one who says freaking like you do .

So long LulzSec , hello INGSOC . Through my generosity , they were able to ship my old mates to the brimstone . In return , I got to walk free . Not like they coulda kept me anyway . <newline> <newline> They installed me in some crappy fastfood joint , and it was there that I met Yoko Nakamoto . She became my waifu at first sight . It was so cute how she tried using PayPal and I had to fumble around like I knew what I was doing . And when we figured it out , we revealed to each other that we were playing dumb just to see if the other was dumb too . She knew me . That scared me . I like being scared . <newline> <newline> I thought it a coincidence at the time , but that niggling little doubt proved true when she namedropped Satoshi as her brother . <newline> <newline> She was rich , and absolutely no one knew it . Since then , we hit it off , became engaged . Never married . We jetset instead . <newline> <newline> That day , I was slumming in Dubai . I wanted a penthouse , but she advised against it , not least because it would be suspicious if a McDonalds fries master were suddenly able to afford a 5 star suite . That meant I 'd face a worldful of reality as I saw firsthand the blackened madness beneath the glitter and neon . Junkies and sinners lined the outsides and it did n't get any better when I got in . <newline> <newline> Slaves on smartphones and broken men singing into satellite dishes , filthy rags lain across roads collecting rain water next to tents half collapsed , little boys running naked into the hands of strange men who barely cared they existed .

It 's modern society undisguised . '' <newline> <newline> One boy I met , they called him Yusef . He told me his real name was 'Number Four ' , and I told him that 's no name at all .

In every one , I put my special little RFID code just to be a big brother to whomever it may concern . <newline> <newline> So of course , I had to bring out the laptop and do a bit of script kiddying all over Google . It was the principle— I had heard about Google Glass 2.0 and , in my infinite disdain for that POS , I decided to check out what Alphabet 's X branch really had in store .

I pulled up a spreadsheet that listed all the contractors . Number one was the Pentagon . Below , however , were various individuals I recognized from the corporate stock listings .

Not on a screen or in a newspaper . They saw it up close , they smelled it and touched it . And it touched them .

    "target": "What can I say . The aliens showed up and everyone pretty much lost their collective minds at the same time . Our initial weapons rush just got knocked out of the skies . Our infrastructure collapsed inside of an hour with their targeted emp pulse weapons . <newline> <newline> They said we could have a second chance . They would be back in a hundred years . What was left of the rest of us at the time , lost the rest of our collective minds for a bit longer . All the rules and boundaries went out the window . The extremists had a short field day . Then the rest of us calmed back down . Then we collectively became angry . Humans at best are usually sociable and polite , but we are very poor losers . <newline> <newline> Well it took a couple of years to get setup again . Not the entire infrastructure had collapsed , just a good part of all the electrical , oil , and natural gas distribution . But it had been enough to shut down the rest for awhile . We lost quite a few electrical generators and some nuclear power plants . No Fukushima 's and no Chernobyl 's . Staff had been quick on hand and go the rods down manually . We lost some staff to radiation though . We honor them still to this day . <newline> <newline> One world coalition is what we came up . Terram Novam . A couple of years of back and forth , a lot of sharing and a lot heavy lifting . Then we did what we did best . Make things better and worse . Well for awhile at least . The eggheads were given almost free reign . You will need to take a tour of the back side of the moon one day . Smiley face and all . <newline> <newline> Now , you really need to understand a couple of things . During the chaos that was the first decade , some little f*cker managed to program a little interface between Watson , Siri , and Google . They also tapped into some of the back ends from China , Russia , USA , and a couple of United Europe nations . Sorry , back ends . Definition : the computer networks , the super computers and clusters that were connected by Old Earth governments . Well it had an unindented effect . The programmer started getting them to talk to each other , the programmer stirred a little , and then they started learning on their own quietly . You must understand , old rivalries die hard even under threat of aliens , and fiedoms do n't get given up easily . <newline> <newline> The eggheads . Given an unmuzzled free reign came up with weapon after weapon , theory after theory , and down the rabbit hole we all went . Unbridled leaps in every field imaginable and new ones became born every 3 months . One of them was practical FTL travel . The next was multipler FTL travel . We could jusmp to Alpha Centari in just under a month . It wound up being called IFTL , Inverted Faster Than Light travel . A bubble within a bubble , without the very worst of the aging effects . <newline> <newline> Then we come to Zga . Zga was a 14 year old unknown genius . She took a phone camera , a piece of chaulk , and spent three hours going through Hawkin 's black hole theory , crossed over to Einstein-Rosen bridge , and the new FTL flight theories . Then posted it to the new uTube . It did n't get a lot of press or views at first . But an AI took an interest and forwarded it to some eggheads with direct questions . Zga did end her video with , `` This is how it is supposed to work at least , but I just do n't know about the practical side . '' Well most of the eggheads looked at it and scoffed at the idea . One did n't . Matt . Matt went through the entire video 4 times and then wrote it out on paper twice . The math was correct with no holes . Matt and Zga were published in iScience after careful reviews , but the math still held up . Then her video became more popular . <newline> <newline> The question from WSG to the eggheads was , `` How do you move an entire solar system ? '' The theory was sound , but the `` ... not sure about the practical side '' took a lot more effort . 5 years of heavy work and more theories , testing , building , moving , and more testing . When it was all done , Sol had one less planet . We offically were an 8 planet system . Pluto took one for the team . <newline> <newline> We still built our weapons , our ships , and had our backup plans . Another 5 years of building and moving . Ceres was mined out along with 75 % of the asteriod belt , Jupiter had a lot less gas , Mars used to be red , and Venus did n't glow as bright in the dark at night . Everything was in place . Then we waited , planned , revised , and practiced elsewhere . Poor Pluto , it did n't just take one for the team . It kept taking it for the team . <newline> <newline> At year 90 ( ish ? ) , we sent our message to them to come to us , we were tired of waiting .

The ship worked by folding space time and whizzing through the fold , in 10 or 15 minutes we would be by Pluto , floating in the freezing outer solar system . The engine continued to groan and pulsate and then I felt the tingling all over my body , we were moving , it was happening . The colours around us started to blur and shift , suddenly the back of the ship was in front of us , yet it was n't . Nothing made visual sense as we flew at hyper speed toward Pluto , to this day it was the most magical experience of my life , and the scariest . <newline> <newline> After 15 minutes , it stopped , there was no sound except for a buzzing , blinking red light on the dashboard . I looked outside and could n't see Pluto , or any of the celestial bodies we were told to expect . I looked at the little red blinking light , we had lost all connections with Earth , the positioning system was just throwing out errors , the computer did n't know where we were . <newline> <newline> Suddenly a black blur flew past , I looked at the other members of the crew and asked if they saw the same thing . They were n't sure , maybe it was an after effect of the space warp flight . It happened again , but this time we all saw the black blur , no one spoke , no one had a rational explanation , this was the first encounter with another alien ship because that thing certainly was n't an asteroid or anything natural . <newline> <newline> Another black blur came past the window , but stopped instantly in front of us . Our ship was now moving toward the bigger black ship , as we got closer we could see the detail it seemed to absorb light , it was blacker than the black emptiness that surrounded it , its hull was covered in rigid spiked and groves . We were still speechless , this was all happening too fast . <newline> <newline> We were dragged inside the ship by an invisible force , and were inside the cargo bay of the ship it was strange and looked different but we could just tell it was a cargo bay of some sort . The inside was mysteriously human almost like military , there was standard lettering throughout the place as if it were sectioned off into parts similar to a big military hanger we were in section 27B . The computer indicated that the air outside was breathable and fine , so we prepared to get out of the ship and meet whoever it was who owned this thing . The fear was gone now , we were the first team to fly a space warping flight , we were resigned to death from the beginning , curiosity was driving us now , not fear . <newline> <newline> As we left the ship a number of armed guards approached us , they were carrying black riffles and wearing gas masks , they were oddly human shaped . They surrounded us and as a man without a uniform or mask walked up to us , we did n't have a single weapon between us , we did n't plan on finding anything we needed to shoot at on Pluto so all we could do was wait . <newline> <newline> `` Who are you '' the unmasked man asked us . We explained we were flying to Pluto . <newline> <newline> `` Pluto was destroyed 500 years ago '' the man said , `` we are in the middle of a war with them , the others , we have colonised several of the moons in our solar system and we are defending our territory . '' <newline> <newline> `` So our co-ordinates are correct ? '' I asked . `` But the time is wrong . '' <newline> <newline> `` It seems like it '' he said , `` its the year 4500 and I am going to guess your warp drive is faulty '' . <newline> <newline> `` How do we get back ? '' I asked , holding back hysteria . <newline> <newline> The man explained that we are stuck here , they ca n't send us back and risk us being killed or captured by the enemy . So we waited , we waited in the hanger inside our ship as we heard deafening explosions all around us , we felt the huge ship shake and rattle , and finally it stopped . <newline> <newline> A team of engineers came on board and fixed our ship , several parts were replaced and we were given a box to take back . <newline> <newline> `` Give this to the intelligence forces when you get back '' he said , `` this box contains what we need to avoid this war . Since you have come from your time , you can go back into it without a paradox being created , maybe you can fix things for us here '' . <newline> <newline> We left the ship , and the computer was preprogrammed to take us back , the light around us blurred and warped again and before we knew it we were by Earth in a stable orbit . We had full communications and told HQ what had happened . <newline> <newline> We had 3 hours to kill until the re-entry window opened again , I could n't help but look in the box , there had to be an amazing piece of technology inside . <newline> <newline> I opened the box , there was nothing inside the box except a hand written note folded"

I stayed in bed because dad never liked it when I bothered him and mom in the middle of the night . Some nights I would hear him talk to someone . They never talked back so I thought he was on the phone . <newline> <newline> One night I got out of bed and went to the kitchen to get some water . I was n't supposed to have any at night because of an accident I had when I was younger but I was so thirsty . Dad left the door to his room open and I saw he was n't in his bed .

I went to brush my teeth and saw that the curtains still had a bit of red on them . I never thought my dad was so clumsy . <newline> <newline> The next night I had the worst nightmare ever . There were loud noises in the air and flashes of light everywhere . When I looked around I could see people lying on the ground and they were all red . When I looked at my hand they were red too .

His face was a blank , emotionless mask . Even his eyes seemed lifeless , staring straight ahead with none of the tics or movements that would indicate a living , breathing organism . <newline> <newline> I stepped up to a urinal , then paused . I glanced at the man again . He was still standing there , staring straight ahead . He seemed to be waiting . <newline> <newline> I reached down towards my zipper , then hesitated . I made a decision . Instead of taking a piss , I turned around and faced the man . <newline> <newline> Still he stood , like a statue , his vacant gaze fixated upon a point just over my right shoulder . I looked him over from head to toe . He was definitely not one of the security personnel hired for this event . I knew all the other guys , and he was not one of us . He was definitely dressed in a security uniform , though , which led me to a disquieting conclusion : he 'd taken a uniform from one of the other guards . <newline> <newline> I pondered confronting him directly . If he was trying to masquerade as a security guard , then he was probably trying to do something covertly . He might reveal something , or even flee , if he knew his cover 's blown . <newline> <newline> Then again , he might not . Confronting him could quickly lead to a fight . The security staff were issued with tasers , as well as a sidearm . The bald man looked to be in fairly good shape , so if he had a taser and a gun , then it would be too risky for me to fight him . <newline> <newline> I decided I needed backup . I would finish my business in the bathroom , then contact my supervisor . We 'd get the rest of the security staff and take this guy down together , before he tried anything . <newline> <newline> I turned back to the urinal . Before I could unzip , though , I felt a sharp prick in the side of my neck . I flailed my arms around wildly as I whirled around . The bald man was holding a half-empty syringe in his right hand . <newline> <newline> `` What the fuck ? What did you just inject into me ? What was that ? '' I yelled at him . I felt faint , but did not lose consciousness . I could fight the drug off . Maybe it was because he was n't able to give me a full dose . <newline> <newline> I was surprised to hear a girl 's voice reply . `` *What the ... that 's never happened before . The tranquilizer is supposed to knock him right out . * '' <newline> <newline> A male voice replied to her , `` *Yeah , and security guard NPCs are n't supposed to talk to you either . Is this from a recent patch or something ? * '' The voices were n't coming from the bald man . They seemed to come from all around me , like ethereal beings speaking to me from another dimension . <newline> <newline> `` Patch ? What are you talking about ? Who 's speaking ? '' I demanded . My mind was growing gradually clearer . I definitely could fight the drug off . <newline> <newline> `` *What the* ***fuck ? ? ? *** '' The male voice practically screamed out . `` *The guard just fucking talked to me ! He talked to me from the game ! * '' <newline> <newline> The girl 's voice , equally panicked , screeched , `` *Turn it off , fucking turn it off ! This is fucked up , Todd , what the fuck ? * '' <newline> <newline> Suddenly , everything around me , from the walls and urinals of the bathroom to the bald man himself , dissolved into electronic static . My surroundings were replaced by complete darkness . It was my turn to mutter in panic , `` What the fuck ? '' <newline> <newline> Then , as abruptly as it had appeared , the darkness vanished , and in its place I found myself standing in a cubical structure , where one wall was entirely a gigantic transparent pane of glass . Through the glass I could see two people , two gigantic teenagers , towering over me as they stared at me in utter shock . The guy , dressed in baggy jeans and a t-shirt with a heavy metal emblem on the chest , still held a video game console controller in his hand . The girl , with both hands covering her mouth out of surprise , looked like she was about to jump out of her goth outfit in fear . <newline> <newline> I looked around . It appeared I was inside a gigantic television set of some sort . Through the glass I could see a couch , lamps , a rug : the furnishings of a living room , all of which was massive compared to my size . I looked down at myself . I was still dressed in my security uniform , and everything seemed normal . Apart from the fact that I was now apparently miniscule , and trapped inside a TV . <newline> <newline> I suppressed the panic that was gnawing at my gut . Panic later , I thought to myself . Right now , you need to figure out what happened , and how you 're going to get back to your world . <newline> <newline> I"

So I became a guide in art gallery . But it ’ s not even THAT fun . We don ’ t have many original paintings , and I believe that copies don ’ t have the same sound as originals . I don ’ t know , maybe it ’ s just me . But you know that feeling when something you thought was original turns out to be a fraud ? It ’ s just feels wrong . It looks the same , sure , but it doesn ’ t *feel* the same . And it also doesn ’ t sound the same . <newline> <newline> But we are getting off track here . So you might think that my favorite art would probably be modern art – you know , all those funny sounds , different tones , notes . But well , it does not sound like dubstep . It ’ s just a mess of weird , unrecognizable sounds . Although I really do like Pollock ’ s *Mural* . Those swirls are great , like musical stave . They guide you to different scales , and sounds that yellow and that funny green of his make – oh God , beautiful symphony . A bit like Beethoven ’ s Moonlight Sonata . Bottom is more like second part , and the more you move to top the more of third movement can be heard . <newline> <newline> Same with Van Gogh ’ s Starry Night . The sky is like Summer from Four Seasons of Vivaldi , with stars and moon being Presto . Cyprus tree is spring – but the calm one . There ’ s not really much to the village , I must admit . A bit of Autumn ’ s Largo . And the middle is hard . That swirl right there – very difficult to compare . I wouldn ’ t say it ’ s the best part ( I personally prefer the rest of sky ) . It kind of mixes up Largo of Autumn and Presto of Summer – it ’ s ok , but could be better . <newline> <newline> I very much prefer older paintings , especially Rococo and Renaissance . I bet everyone wants to know how Mona Lisa sounds like – and I must say nothing extraordinary . The painting and colors are rather calm , nothing dynamic over there . And it hurts the music . It sounds like sea . Waves are lazy and slow , they don ’ t really clash but kind of dab the shore . <newline> <newline> But Rococo , that ’ s different story . Let ’ s take The Swing by Fragonard . The woman in the center is just a full orchestra , playing in perfect harmony one of fastest arrangement of Dance of the Hours by Amilcare Ponchielli I ’ ve ever heard . But there are no clash cymbals . <newline> <newline> I could go on and on with this , but let ’ s cut it short . I also hear buildings , tough they are rather low pitched . And I got used to it , so there ’ s nothing to describe . I only work one way – so I don ’ t see colors while hearing sounds . And also , I do not paint . I can ’ t paint . I mean , I can , but then the sounds are terrible , and I feel terrible . And if the sounds are nice , then the whole composition and coloring is hell . So I don ’ t do art . But I like it . <newline> <newline> ______ <newline> No synesthesia whatsover , just wanted to have a go at imagining it . Also , it does differate a bit from normal synesthesia from what I know . But he kind of fits the description , so here you go ! <newline>"

After the last life threatening disease ever to exist on this sphere was eradicated in 5645 AD , perfection as a race was not very far away . No more hunger , no more poverty , no sickness , and most importantly , no more death . This held up for almost 6 decades and we could n't be more proud of ourselves . Our leading scientists devised a formula that recoded our DNA to regenerate indefinitely and interminably . This made us immortal . You know how they say that you acquire a new body every 10 years ? Well imagine acquiring one every 10 months . The formula was designed to also stop aging at 25 years of age , which meant you could be 100 years old and maintain the body of a 30 year old . We had made ourselves immortal . We became gods , and not gods like those of Egyptian folklore , or those found in Rome or Greece , no ! We were real gods . After almost 60 years of no deaths in the world , things were beginning to get tight . We could n't build any higher to fit all of the population and we were running out of food . Only one solution was created , an anti-formula that took our immortality , and reduced it to a mere 100 years to fulfill our dreams and desires . What were we thinking playing God . Everyone was given this `` vaccine '' and within months , those that were approaching 100 years old , those who had received the immortal vaccine back in 5645 in their mid 40 's , slowly began to die off . It was the turn of the millennium we were returning to a manageable population . Of course not everyone was ok with this . There was a small group , a small sect if you will that defied this order and never got the immortality ending formula . The formula was never made again to teach those that did n't get it a lesson that immortality is n't all that it seems to be . Of course there were public records that showed everyone 's age and their exact 100th birthday , and everyday the Remain Extracting and People Eradication Responders ( R.E.A.P.E.R ) would go out in search for those correspondents whose day it was to be , well , eliminated or extracted . So we come to me . Why am I so special ? Truth be told I 'm not , but it just happens that yesterday was my turn to be extracted . I 'm still alive , I 'm not dead . I 'm terrified , have I done something wrong ? Last night I had a dream of a man with a long gray beard . I remember lots of running and hiding . But most of all , I remember crying and bullets and blood . Why am I not dead . My time is up . I 'm 100 years and 1 day old . The REAPER has n't come for me yet and I 'm starting to get worried . Am I really complaining that I 'm not dead ? This morning I found a diary . Mostly old pictures and a letter . In those pictures are two men and a child . It 's the man with the long gray beard from my dreams ! I read the letter . My grandfather and father . The leader of the sect that did n't get vaccinated . No records of me ever existing . Bullets wo n't do good since my flesh will regenerate in a months time . I 'm stuck here forever . I have to find them ! ! !"

    "target": "I had finally figured it all out - and Roland was not there ! It was rare for the old scholar to be out of his study on an afternoon like this . He had even left the outside door open , and his black cat Bayard was idly stalking a frog that had just wandered in . I threw Bayard into the library , the frog back outside , closed the door , and sank into the plushy armchair holding tightly to the ancient box . <newline> <newline> The long years of our search passed in front of my eyes as I closed them . I had n't thought much of Professor Roland back when I first met him - and he had a terrible reputation among my peers to boot . Who even studies Medieval Latin these days ? I was practically forced into his class after a drunken bout made me miss all other opportunities to satisfy that last , pesky distribution requirement . But when he showed up with his long white beard , calm demeanor , and the only extant copy of a breathtaking illuminated manuscript - I was instantly hooked . Has it really been 15 years of poring over old tomes together ? It felt more like a single semester . <newline> <newline> `` And that semester is almost over '' I thought proudly while looking at the old box in my lap . Just imagine the look on Roland 's face when I tell him that I , his best student and intellectual heir , had figured out how to unseal it ! Looking at it , the handiwork of Aelfgar of Lindisfarne was very pretty indeed . His contemporaries had acclaimed him as the last true wizard - and it showed . The careful engravings of angels , demons , pentagrams and other occult symbols were interspersed with knobs and protrusions that made the box look almost like the cockpit controls of a modern space shuttle . You could pull and turn and change the configuration in myriad different ways . But you had to be careful with such an old artifact . Aelfgar had made three of them , and only two were still extant . We had found them last summer in the claustrophobic confines of an attic in an old English abbey . It was really no problem to get them loaned for research - the parson did not even know he had them , much less appreciated their true value . <newline> <newline> But where was that Roland already ? ! It 's been almost an hour - and I just could n't wait to tell him my brilliant idea . It had been suggested by our conversation the night before , really . Roland had casually mentioned his finding that Aelfgar had been a follower of Saint Aedelberht ; and as I was sleeping last night my mind 's eye had put two and two together , and realized that the symbols on the box were actually the same as those in the Aedelberht Manuscript , which had deeply puzzled Roland and me not three years back . Checking my notes this morning confirmed it - the Manuscript was the key to opening Aelfgar 's boxes ! As my mentor was notorious for holding on to loaned materials , I had little doubt that the Aedelberht Manuscript was still in his possession . <newline> <newline> Impatience got the best of me at this point , and I started pacing around the room . Sheer boredom made me notice a tome that was slightly out of place on my mentor 's desk . There was a pentagram on the cover and ... by Jove , if it 's not the Aedelberht Manuscript itself ! I smiled triumphantly at my good fortune . Last night 's discussion had made Roland retrieve it , and here was the answer to all my fervent wishes ! <newline> <newline> Should I wait for the old man ? But who knows when he might be back . For all I know it will be another two hours - and in the meanwhile here I am with the old box and the manuscript ! I might as well try it - if it works I 'll show him how to open his own box . With feverish hands I follow the instructions in the old tome , pressing knobs and turning dials . What incredible works of art or wisdom might be sealed inside these amazing boxes ! The thoughts rush through my head as I approach the end of the long sequence . A final turn , and ... is this real ? ! <newline> <newline> The box slowly rises up into the air , slowly dissolving as rays of light stream out of it and into my very soul it seems . I can feel something incredibly good and powerful coursing through my veins ... it feels amazing . I can feel ... MAGIC ! ? ! Aelfgar ... he was truly the last wizard ... it was his very power that he sealed inside these boxes ! ! ... and now it 's mine ... all mine ... it 's IN ME ! I point my hand at the heavy armchair I used a few minutes ago ... and it rises up into the air , obeying my will perfectly . <newline> <newline> I am ... a wizard . Yeah , me - who would have thought ? ! Even the crusty old tome makes sense now . It talks to me about ways to use the power ... I effortlessly absorb all its wisdom ... it talks about ... WHAT ? ! `` After the ritual is complete , you must recite this incantation while burning the hair of a black cat and the puff of a dandelion . If you do not do so then all your power"

I was chilling in my room , watching some dance moms , when my fucking P.A . runs in and screams that you , kid-G had just jumped off a cliff . So I had to go fucking save you . And god , you 're heavy , did I mention that ? And do you know what the worst part is ? I still have the old foxtel box , so I could n't even record the rest or pause it . So now I 'm fucking missing it . '' <newline> <newline> He paused to take a deep breath . <newline> <newline> `` Fuck you , kid .

Probably not , I thought to myself , my brain could have thought of better insults . My head was sore , I must have bumped it on the way down . That did n't matter though , because I was alive ! I smiled broadly . <newline> <newline> There was another poof of white smoke . I coughed . <newline> <newline> `` Oi kid , '' Randy Muchas added `` Do n't you dare tell anyone you saw me . Otherwise I 'll lose my job and hunt you down . I have n't had human meat <newline> in a while , it 's a rare illegal delicacy .

I took one of the fragile bottles in my hands , held it up to the light . On the bottom was a label with a name . `` Alex Jones '' . I shrugged , not knowing who that was . <newline> <newline> `` They have our names on it , '' I guessed out loud . By then more than half the group had joined me and were busy inspecting the bottles . <newline> `` Yeah , you 're right . This one 's mine , '' the skinny girl from earlier announced . After a few minutes of shuffling and swapping , we each had our own bottles . <newline> <newline> `` Are we supposed to drink it ? '' a tall boy asked , scowling . `` What if it 's poisonous ? '' <newline> I stared at him blankly . `` Why would they want to poison us ? '' <newline> He shrugged . `` The government does all sorts of weird shit . '' <newline> <newline> I turned the bottle around in my palm . Other than my name , there were no other markings on its transparent surface . A light blue liquid swished inside of it . <newline> <newline> The skinny girl shrugged and uncapped the bottle . Before we could say anything , she downed every drop . <newline> <newline> The scowling boy all but slapped the bottle from her hands . `` Are you crazy ! ? You have no idea what 's in that !

Poison immunity , '' she sounded out slowly . `` I guess it tells you your power after you drink it . '' <newline> <newline> Not being able to stand more waiting , I wrenched the cap off the bottle , nearly crushing it in my palm . `` Sounds good to me , '' I said , taking a long swig . Immediately I wanted to gag . The girl was right- it tastes overly sweet . I almost instantly see a word . No ... two words . <newline> <newline> LIMITED PRECOGNITION <newline> <newline> I blinked . The words slowly faded . _Limited precognition ? Limited how ? _ I wondered . I looked around at everyone drinking , slowly swallowing and wincing at the sugary taste .

After double checking the indicators , then rechecking again because he could n't believe it , mission specialist Alan Berkman bolted from his desk and up the stairs to the NASA Director 's office . Wheezing and sweating from the effort , a reminder to Berkman that he 'd spent too much time at a computer and not enough outside in his life , he barged into the Director 's office with no regard for the meeting going on . <newline> <newline> The Director stared at him with annoyance . `` What the hell ? You scientists never seem to learn what 's appropriate when it comes to office behavior ! '' Berkman peered at the little man through fogged up glasses rimed with sweat , wondering obliquely how such an obtuse person could ever become head of the world 's premier space agency . <newline> <newline> `` It 's Voyager , '' he said between gasps of air . `` She 's beaming incredible amounts of data back to us !

Years as a politician meant the director had contributed little to the pursuit of science and human advancement , but had gained him a keen sense of when his own butt might be in danger . `` Get me NORAD , '' the Director barked at his secretary , `` now ! '' <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Air Force General Brad `` Buzzkill '' Tolliver stood in a sea of blue uniforms lit by the glow of hundreds of screens and the fluorescent lighting under the mountain . Deep within NORAD 's headquarters under Cheyenne Mountain a veritable army of airmen , technicians , scientists , and suits from every three-letter government agency went about their business with nervous efficiency . The word was some of the boys in Cryptology were on the verge of a breakthrough in decoding what was now termed the 'Voyager Dump ' . First contact with extraterrestrial life ... The General mulled the prospect over silently . This was a once in a lifetime opportunity . If the aliens had a message of peace , the General could surely get Congress to double or even triple the Air Force budget in the name of intergalactic relations . And if they had a message of war ? Well then Buzzkill Tolliver would be set to lead the charge in space with probably ten times the normal budget ! It would be a win either way . <newline> <newline> A clamor broke out at the nearest terminal , men started to huddle around a single monitor . `` Sir , I think we 've got it ! '' shouted a tech sergeant . <newline> <newline> `` Put it on the main screen son , '' replied the General , brushing his officer 's coat in case any lint had landed . He did n't want to look sloven for the press briefing later on . A large golden square began to de-pixilate on the jumbotron sized screen for all to see . Lines took shape , clearly etched lines on a golden metal surface . It looked like.. <newline> <newline> `` Sir , it 's a dick ! '' shouted the same tech sergeant . True enough , a twelve foot tall etching of a human male anatomy stood displayed for all to see . The General turned beet red . <newline> <newline> `` What in the hell kind of joke is this ? '' he demanded . `` Goddamit , what is- '' Another airman interrupted him . <newline> <newline> `` Sir , it looks like it might be an image of the [ plaque on the side of the old Pioneer ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque # mediaviewer/File : Pioneer_plaque_humans.svg ) probe ! '' In glorious high resolution , the male member <newline> was displayed for all to see . Questions swirled immediately . Was this a hoax ? Some sort of fraud ? Every indication seemed to be that the transmission had some from deep space via Voyager 's equipment , but how would it get an image from a completely different probe , let alone one so vulgar as this ? <newline> <newline> The computer spat out additional data . `` Sir , I think the decrypting program is picking up a number of text based artifacts in the transmission . Displaying them now ! '' Excitedly , the airman let the messages roll off to the big screen as the program finished . <newline> <newline> `` Sweet Jesus ... '' muttered Buzzkill Tolliver . As the words spilled onto the screen , it was clear explaining this to Congress would be difficult . <newline> <newline> *Hay hooman , why so small ? It cold in space ? * read the first message . *Lololo probe probably sent by hooman females looking for real pachingiang ! * The program was clearly filling in with garbage for parts of the message it could n't translate . *How you expect to explore galaxy with such tiny male parts ?

Why would the stock price of a mid-level gold acquisitions company skyrocket because of some hacktivism ? Especially considering our key demographic is over 60 . '' <newline> <newline> Frank frowned . `` Jack , you 're obviously stringing together things that do n't exist .

Look -- '' <newline> <newline> Frank cut him off . `` *Enough* , '' he whispered . He looked at the door . People milled around outside . He walked over and shut the door . <newline> <newline> He turned to Jack . `` Alright , I do n't know what you *think* you know , but I would can that shit right now .

Whatever you 're doing is most likely illegal . I have a family to feed , and I wo n't be caught up -- '' <newline> <newline> Frank yelled at him . `` Do n't talk to me about feeding your family ! What the hell do you think we 're doing here ? You think Gold is worth anything anymore ? Absolutely not ! We cater to senior citizens because it 's what they were raised on . They were raised thinking precious metals was a solid investment . <newline> <newline> Things took a turn Jack , and we were hemorrhaging money . The only thing that motivates people more than money is fear of losing it . So I did what any one would do : I created the demand . Did you happen to check what newspapers run those hacktivism stories ? How each time those stories appear , they are initially bare-bones and without technical acuity ? They 're geared *toward* seniors , to drive up the fear . Which in turn motivates them to buy shares in Gold . '' <newline> <newline> Frank slammed his fist on the table . `` This game has been rigged the entire time ! It 's not about anything more than putting food on the table . I hired out a bunch of college kids to run small penetration tests on our partners , and in turn our partners get kickbacks ! <newline> <newline> I ca n't lose this company , Jack . It 's been far too long in the making . I saw us losing money and I had to do something . Fear motivates people to give me money . <newline> <newline> And that 's why I was forced to create this world . '' <newline> <newline> Jack reached in his pocket and pulled out a tape recorder . He pressed stop . <newline> <newline> `` That 's what I needed to hear . '' He said ."

The tribunal stared at him angrily while asking the same questions over and over again . He felt like he 'd been asked how the pod malfunctioned by seven different people , and now an eighth was asking . <newline> <newline> `` You expect us to believe that a billion dollar pod manufactured by Stegus Corp , with triple redundant guidance systems and a host of tech meant to keep it together under high g-force , the vacuum of space , and under heavy ordinance fire just disintegrated upon reentry into H1M1 's atmosphere ? '' The woman who he could n't quite place was almost spitting out each word . <newline> <newline> `` No ma'am . Like I said before , '' he said nervously `` it was after main reentry . The capsule passed through something , a cloud or layer of atmosphere that never happened on any simulations , and then all the tech went down . It was a few seconds after that that the shell peeled off in bits . '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's completely unbelievable Sargent . '' The woman huffed . Someone approached her and whispered in her here and she sneered even more . `` I have nothing more for this ... person . '' He later learned that she was the technical liaison between Stegus Corp and the military . <newline> <newline> Another questioner leaned forward in his seat to look down upon Wilks . <newline> <newline> `` So the story so far is the pod dissolved , you pulled the e-chute in your suit and got dumped into the ocean , is that right ? '' The man said in a seemingly nice tone . <newline> <newline> `` Yes sir . '' Wilks responded . <newline> <newline> `` And after that you found yourself on an island without any rations ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes sir , the rations were in a pack built into the pod along with weapons and ordinance . '' <newline> <newline> `` But you were n't issued a weapon for this flight , is that correct ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No sir , this was just a simulation . We were supposed to be popped , attempt a no-g egress , ingress and return . '' <newline> <newline> `` But you ended up on planet ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes sir '' Wilks responded , again . <newline> <newline> `` So for four days you were on planet without equipment , no beacon , and no weapon and survived on this little island .

'' The man asked seeming a little more frustrated . <newline> <newline> `` People keep asking me that and I do n't understand what they mean . What camping party ? I did n't eat anyone sir . '' Wilks said sheepishly . <newline> <newline> `` Sargent , did you or did you not hunt down , kill , and eat while you were on the island ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well ... yeah ... uh ... yes sir . On day three ... I uh ... I was pretty hungry at that point and had n't been able to catch any fish or anything , so I went inland ... '' he recounted . <newline> <newline> `` And ... '' the man asked . <newline> <newline> `` And there were these crabs , sorta hairy but like crabs we have back home ... and um ... they climbed up on this tree I guess . I mean it looked sorta like a tree but not really our kind of tree . I figured they might be edible , so I tried to get them out of the tree but they went pretty high up . At that point I had a sharp rock already so I just hacked the tree down . '' Wilks continued to tell the panel . <newline> <newline> The man sat back and commented . `` Let the record show that this is the point where Sargent Wilks assaulted , '' he looked down at a paper in front of him `` Fluh Nor Marginonin '' he spoke slowly over the last three syllables . <newline> <newline> `` What ?

'' Wilks was confused trying to match up what the man was saying with what was in his head about the events . He had been alone on the island the entire time . He 'd never met anyone that he could have assaulted much less killed anyone . <newline> <newline> `` Then what happened mister Wilks ? '' The man asked . <newline> <newline> `` I cooked the crabs sir ? '' Wilks said hesitantly . <newline> <newline> `` And ... ? '' The man prompted . <newline> <newline> `` And ate them sir ?

That 's how I would describe myself . `` I write books '' would be the reply to the never ending question of `` What do you do ? '' . Yet here I was , six months down the line , seventeen chapters written and nowhere further to go . The inspiration had stopped a while ago now . Calling yourself a writer comes with advantages . It means brains , it means confidence , it means interest ; with those things comes women . Women who want to tell their friends that their boyfriend is a writer , who want to be some sensitive soul 's muse . To be the inspiration for some beautiful piece of work . A penniless romantic , what could be better than that ? <newline> <newline> I have a way with words , always have . Any argument or dispute in a relationship could be dealt with . she 'd tried to leave me six times now . I talked her out of it every time . It only took five minutes- it was why she fell for me in the first place . She knew she could come to me with any issue and I could make her feel better about it in five minutes . It was a critical way of living , but it worked . The women do n't leave because I convince them that it just does n't make sense . Every discussion would carry a different theme . Guilt , perhaps . That was always an easy one , especially when it was constructed to lead themselves to that conclusion- when the only response is `` I 'm being selfish . '' They never leave- Not when I 've written myself as the perfect partner . <newline> <newline> I suppose that 's where the inspiration goes . I stop writing when I 'm too busy writing myself . It 's a lot of effort to hide everything , to make sure you cover every plot hole , to set up placements for later developments . The discussion is written before she even comes into the room , I know how she 'll react because by this stage , I 've practically written her too . <newline> <newline> She 'll walk in after work today- she 'll tell me she 's having doubts again . `` Not spending enough time with me '' is what she 'll say . But I 've already worked it out . <newline> <newline> `` I understand that . I know it 's hard . I hate it as well , but I 'm still struggling with the writing . I 've written quite a lot this week , you 've really helped me through it all . I need you to understand that I do appreciate everything we have and whilst I know its not been that fair on you , I 'm doing it for both of us . Once this gets published I 'll have so much more time for us . You said you wanted to go to Rome again , we can do that as soon as the first check comes in . I love you babe , you know I do . I 'm not choosing to spend time away from you , that 's the last thing I want- but I have to do this right now . Soon that will be over and we can just go back to how it was . We 'll be back to watching DVDs at night , I promise . Just a couple of more weeks . I love you . '' <newline> <newline> Always end with I love you . They have to say it back , especially after that . It 's my sacrifice , its my hardship , and she 's just a passenger . I do n't say it , but that 's how it will make her feel . Hell , it will probably lead to guilt sex . <newline> <newline> Still , that being said , the grant money does run out next week ... <newline> <newline> She walks into the room and looks at the half burned out cigarette on the desk . As I type furiously on the keyboard she walks up behind me . <newline> <newline> `` Babe , I really feel like we are n't spending enough time with one another . '' <newline> <newline> `` OK '' <newline> <newline> For five minutes she stands there . Not saying anything .

News coverage around the world quickly shifted from political upheavals in the Middle-East and mindless celebrity trivia to nearly 24/7 coverage of the `` Glacier Race '' .

It was 2023 when the first body was discovered . With a sinew-laden arm and bony fingers extended as though reaching for help , a well-preserved human corpse was discovered beneath the newly-dubbed Zone 4 of the arctic layer . The first three Zones , each taking up several miles of glacier , had only contained ancient machinery and old-fashioned technology , but as the ice melted and humanity delved , a grim portrait of our evolutionary line was painted before our eyes . Contained perfectly within the sapphire-blue depths was a makeshift fossil record of human-kind . The global uproar was too large to be contained or covered up , and mankind was forced to face new questions about its existence that it had n't encountered before . Had others existed before them ? What did this mean about Earth 's past ? What did it mean for humanity 's future ? <newline> <newline> All of this was for naught , however , when the rising ocean levels and increasing global temperature took its miserable toll upon the surviving ten countries . The project was abandoned , and we never got to unveil the deepest layers of ice , what laid below Zone 4 , and humanity focused solely upon its survival . It was the year 2135 when the toxic fumes that had taken the place of the ozone layer finally suffocated its last victim . The planet by this point was an utterly barren , frozen wasteland , much of the surface having been flooded and irradiated beyond livable conditions . At least , for any life such as us , who sought answers inside a tomb of the past rather than innovation for the future . <newline> <newline> Cycle : Restart ."

    "target": "When you choose to become a demon , it can be nerve-wracking . It ’ s new , exciting , and you don ’ t always get to choose who you possess or torment . I find that it ’ s best to keep a level head , and keep you ’ re nose to the grindstone . The work is tough but fair . <newline> <newline> On a few rare occasions , you might win the lottery , literally . We have a lottery on the first and third Tuesdays of every month . The winnings vary , but every Christmas they offer one Hitler possession . As you know , there are 666 of us , so the odds aren ’ t all that bad . I was lucky enough to get the Hitler prize two years in a decade . I had so much fun the first time , but I thought it would just be in the spirit of things to give to those in greater need . Just a few weeks earlier we received a new replacement for an out of date demon . The youngest ever demon , eight years old ! I couldn ’ t help myself , I wanted to see what she could do . She was itching to prove herself , obviously . She was inspiring , but she was suspended for several months after trying to possess multiple entities at once . It ’ s very dangerous if you didn ’ t know . Only a rare few have ever survived that very feat . <newline> <newline> We spent a lot of time together in those months , and we soon became fast friends . She was grateful , but she also came to find she could confide in me . For I was the only other demon in existence at the time who had survived a multiple possession . It ’ s a euphoric experience , which is hard to kick . It ’ s for good reason that you are put on suspension . That , however , does not mean you have all the free time in the universe . You must ride out your punishment as an on call , to be summoned , demon . <newline> <newline> The only warning you receive is for a mere 5-10 seconds before being summoned you go blind and deaf except for a faint buzzing in the ears . I explained this all to our newest recruit , for she was frightened . You may have expected a harder reserve from a demon , but we are very misunderstood . As I told you before , we celebrate Christmas . I mean there are of course more virgin sacrifices then mistletoe but I ’ m sure you can see the fun in that . <newline> <newline> I had to go back 70 years to explain my stint for the on call punishment I served . Times have certainly changed , but I ’ m telling you , teenage girls have not . Oh yes , these were the most offensive of punishments . For there is nothing more fearsome than a teenage girl . Unfortunately , thanks to the different timezones , you could be called on at any second of the day . Most importantly , due to one of the 666 rules we have to abide by ( of course ) , we have to stay with those that call upon us until we are released . <newline> <newline> I shared all I could with my young apprentice as she peppered me with questions . I tried to explain that her experience as an 8 yr old girl would be far different than mine as a nearly 1200 yr demon permanently stuck as a 74 yr old man . I ’ m sure her plight will not be easy , but I hope her patience lasts longer than mine did…"

Todd was proud of his handiwork around the house and barely noticed that Gail seemed unusually quiet for someone visiting a childhood home . When they returned to the front door , she thanked him for the tour . <newline> <newline> `` I do n't believe I 'll get the chance to look around the rest of the neighborhood ; have they changed anything since you 've been here ?

Todd folded his arms against the autumn chill , thinking back . `` Well , they replaced that old steel slide in the playground with a plastic one -- I think someone 's kid cut himself on it -- but actually the playground was n't even here until a year before we moved in , so you do n't remember it I 'm sure . Oh , and there was a big old oak tree they had to cut down to make room for a new train station that 's going up on South Boulevard .

I have lots more 'old haunts ' to visit before moving day . '' <newline> <newline> Todd followed her down the steps , shivering a bit . `` Gail , I did n't even ask you , where are you moving to ? '' <newline> <newline> She stared at the clouds , webbed with jet trails and power lines . `` Someplace I can start over . '' <newline> <newline> The moment hung in the air with the smell of imminent rain , then Gail turned , smiled and stuck out her hand . `` Thanks a lot , Todd . Good luck to you and yours .

I know the man was offering me an inebriating beverage , because I 've already had three , and I am indeed beginning to feel the effects . I 'm certainly grateful for having been fortunate enough to spend 4 years at university in my youth . If my brain cells were n't used to this sort of abuse , my cover would have been blown after my first cup . This is an interesting concoction , I 'll admit . What 's interesting more is how it seems everyone here is imbibing some potion , or breathing some sort of toxin . Behaviors that were strictly forbidden under the Illumination are commonplace in the darkness . How this culture of mindless indulgence has resisted the power and the truth of the Great One is perhaps the greatest mystery of this land . <newline> <newline> `` Ya did n't say 'no ' , now did ya ? `` , he said as he filled my cup with a milky pink liquid . The scoundrel . At home , I could simply decline his offering , but I 'm not home . I cheers him , drink the whole cup in one gulp , pay the man , and walk out into the moonlit square . I need to get back to my lodge before the feeding . How any sort of civilization could develop under such harsh conditions is well worth an investigation . Honestly , I tend to think my mission is foolish . Why would we not want to learn about the humanity under the darkness , rather than subvert them so ? But alas , the only fool must be I , to question the imperatives of the His Greatness . <newline> <newline> As I meander down the stone-paved avenue , I continue to marvel at the society I see . The clothing is so bizarre , with ill-fitting robes and puffy wrappings on their heads . Andhe commerce is so disorganized , the interactions so frank . All of these unfamiliarities must be amplified , too , by the effects of that drink . I certainly have begun to experience the advertised effects of perceptions of colorful light . The sky appears to be lit green . Though , I know it is black , despite my hallucination . This effect continues strengthening . Even the faintest glimmer of light is now vibrant and colorful . I know I 'm under the influence of a potion , but still , I need to get a grip . I pull out my pouch of tobacco and roll up a smoke . I see a stool up against the outside wall of one of these buildings lining the pedestrian avenue , so I take a seat and enjoy the calming nicotine . Finally . <newline> <newline> The street is emptying . People are hurriedly shuffling into their lodges as if a massive storm was about to strike . I 'm the only person who remains still , enjoying my smoke , gazing absently down the avenue . Weird and mysterious , this society is . And in the week I 've been here , I 've regrettably come to feel enchanted by it all . These people get along , without polite pleasantries , without the strict order and eternal love of the Great One . It seems to defy everything I 've been raised to know as truth - that submission and servitude to the Enlightened is the only path to fulfillment . <newline> <newline> : :more to come later today : :"

They were not efficient , but it did n't matter , there was never a shortage of light from the horrible red star and like usual , all the lights were green . The power lines never went down , but occasionally did develop noise that could create power surges , but Max hardly ever saw signs of that . <newline> <newline> By the time the Foundation Day tune stopped , Max had grown bored of watching the winds of the Curtain buffet a pair of workers as they got into their cab of the monorail . Their destination one of the many cities on the night side , to be sure . Max 's shift did n't end for hours . maybe he would cheat a bit and watch a vid . He was n't supposed to , but when the Supervisor was n't around , the only person in the facility was himself . <newline> <newline> Max had been watching an old series about Earth . Earth was a proper planet that had day and nights and weather and a moon and a star that did n't look like a boil . Not that anyone ever heard from Earth much anymore , apparently for the past couple of hundred years , there was some sort of ecological disaster there , Max did n't know the details , it did n't matter , the vid 's story was set from before the Diaspora when electricity was n't discovered yet . Max watched it with a longing that he felt in the deepest parts of himself . There were animals , green grass , and women who 's only concern in life was which wealthy man they wanted to marry . The world just supported them , not like on Coin , where every inch of life needed to be taken from the light side and carved out of the ice on the dark side . Max liked to imagine himself as a farmer . <newline> <newline> There was an alarm . It was strange to hear , because Max had previously only heard it on training vids . He looked over at the console and saw that there was no power on his lines . Something had gone terribly wrong . There was no power ! Max tripped the alarm and got on the phone with his contact at Solar Array 42 . It rang and picked up . <newline> <newline> `` Steve ! Steve ! Are you there ? What is going on ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Max ! They 've set off bombs ! '' Steve replied . `` They are shutting down the power to all of Coin ! <newline> <newline> `` Who ? '' Max yelled the question . The lights from the street outside started to go out . <newline> <newline> `` They call themselves The Liberation Army of Gelise . They are- '' the line went dead . <newline> <newline> Max looked up and the lights went out in the office as well . The only light coming from his badge and communicator . Outside his window , the only light was being belched from the north , all power was off . Max knew from his training , how much time there was to restore power before the night side froze , 3 days . Max also knew without the monorail , nobody from the night side was going to be able to get to the borderlands , where you could live if you could stand the winds . <newline> <newline> Max knew what he had to do , if Coin was going to survive , he needed to get the power back on ."

Perhaps ironically , this first mating ritual is more complicated than any of the others , often occurring at the age of 16 . <newline> <newline> Ah . Here we see a lone male approach a female . It is often the male that begins the ritual , despite both parties equally capable of feeling emotion , and this one knows his trade . He stands up straight , walking with a confident swagger a slight smile playing across his lips . It is a delicate balance , the beginning of this ritual , and the most crucial - for if the initial approach fails , the ritual stops before it can even be started . <newline> <newline> Nevertheless , this quite adept male approaches the female in his buttoned down shirt and well groomed hair , putting him miles ahead of the rest of his unshaved , ungroomed pack . He has been watching the female for a while now , has even conversed with her , and knows when she is normally without her pack , for normally females of this age travel together in order to further intimidate males , such that only the most confident may dare approach , naturally making mates of a higher quality . <newline> <newline> The approach is something to marvel at , truly . Light on his feet , but no so light as to be malicious he walks up behind her taps the female on the shoulder . She whirls around , her mouth an O of surprise . The male apologizes , insisting he didn ’ t mean to startle her , and the female smiles , understanding . The two talk for a bit of casual , superficial things . This is the most important part of the dance , the feigning disinterest . They both know there is only one reason the male would seek out the female in such a fashion , yet they do not bring it up . They talk of sports , of class , of other males and females . In fact , the male says goodbye and turns to leave . Now the female frowns , confused , but at the last moment the male asks the question . Done in such a way as it were an afterthought , that he had not initiated the whole conversation with that in mind . <newline> <newline> The female smiles and , nonchalantly , says why not , as if she were merely not opposed to the idea when in reality she is delighted . <newline> <newline> Both walk away , jubilant , blissfully unaware of the other ’ s desire . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> However , this is an ideal ritual , where the approach , the evasion , the time , the look are all executed with almost utmost perfection . <newline> <newline> But most such rituals are doomed to failure due to mishaps , often on the male side . Recall , that it is the male who propositions , and thus he has more room for mistakes . <newline> <newline> Let ’ s take another male . Already we see the differences from the first . His hands are rubbing together in nervousness , his skin is oily , his air unkempt . And perhaps worst of all he has worn an attire known as Cargo Shorts . Utter abominations sure to repel not only females , but male compatriots . <newline> <newline> He approaches the female in the height of her power , surrounded by her pack members . He walks , lumbering as he does , so the entire pack stares at him for 30 seconds are so until he finally reaches them . <newline> <newline> His face red he does not banter or feign disinterest , no , he just asks the question . The female smiles and opens her mouth to answer , but before she can her pack howls in laughter . The female freezes , and after a moment ’ s hesitation , forces herself to chuckle .

For some people , a far-off date and time was a sign of prestige .

Surely if the clock did n't read right then there was something else , there had to be . But I tried to push it to the back of my mind , and put on a smile for everyone .

People were concerned that my 'time ' was finally coming , but I simply shook my head and said `` Trust me , it ca n't be 'coming ' . '' After all , I should 've already died , right ?

At some point I did n't have any lead left , and just scratched across the papers with an invisible bit of graphite .

    "target": "A five dollar latte and some shitty gluten free granola bar at the Grindhouse . This was the meal Emanuel had chosen after his late afternoon pretend to exercise exhaustion . So plain was the interior of this hipster inspired dive that the cups were Disney hand-me-downs from the owners mother . With them faded images of gallant knights , cute animals and princesses with hair and hips that confirm its our fault our daughters are so messed up . As the scalding arabica hit Emanuel 's lips he felt a sudden tinge in his spine . A cold chill known only to those who have played their Deja Vu over and over until the reality of their existence and faliciy of their minds began to muddle . Normally he would think nothing of it , attribute it to having those lousy discount running shoes and trot along home to pound a drink and a pillow . Not today though , today was the unfortunate day where a tinge along the discs would become manifest in an idea . So simple most have thought it and tucked it away in a pit as to not challenge the fragile chains we have so painfully constructed around our lives , the noose that keeps us in line . Today was the day he took his fathers Beretta 418 and painted his apartment in red relief . He would put it in his mouth , close his eyes and quietly go into the dark that had already consumed so many other suburbanites . Or perhaps he would point it at his temple and scream as his Norse ancestors did before they enacted the blood toll on the early Christians . In an instant he would be dead and either facing his god or simply ceasing to be anything . <newline> With no need to race home Emanuel began to stroll into the `` nice '' part of town . It was not the seedy underpass of his youth , with preteen hookers looking to score and junkies looking to die . Nor was the the upscale gardens where he worked curating some of the finest food in the city for what had to be the worst people on the planet . With every amuse-bouche wasted on pallets not better then the puntable dogs they carried he felt his talents wasted on those who cared more that the food was expensive then it was good . He once bought a craze case and garnished with rotten kale to serve at a governors private party . A little wine paired with self delusion and all the members believed they were in on the hottest new culinary craze . No , this was the working class `` brown shingles '' as he had come to name them . Unkempt sidewalks and yellow grass rings marked those with the young children . Halloween decorations up in March and against HOA marked the old ones . A place whos name was so generic a gps had a qualifier before you could find it . Where families come to exist and nothing more . <newline> It was quiet . To say it was silent would be a lie , there existed sound to remind Emanuel he was not in a nightmare . That sound though was foreign to the criteria of his working class neighborhood . No kids running around playing war as Fox news had taught them . No teens claiming they are moving to Canada due to the distressing nature of American healthcare they have never once paid into or even considered . No the sounds were much more empty , as if made by one who knew deception required noise but knew nothing of this place . After feeling euphoric in his decision all day , for the first time in years he felt fear . A man with no will to live should fear nothing but the failure his act might bring , and Emanuel knew he was smarter than all the pathetic cretins who had tried to off themselves and failed . So why did he feel so afraid in this moment . <newline> `` I remember this road . '' <newline> How long had Emanuel been staring at this man , clad in dirt and debris as common as every homeless man in Seattle and yet so foreign , as if it had been stolen from low bid sci-fi movie studio . The man was ancient ; a face with more wrinkle than discernible human attribute and eyes of cataract and regret . Yet his posture was tall and strong and he had a purpose in his lips that demanded attention . '' <newline> `` I do n't have any money '' Emanuel spoke to diffuse the crazed homeless man . <newline> `` I know what you are planning on doing my son . March 18th 2034 in Apartment 15E in the Grovepoint suites . Emanuel Leed attempted suicide with a Beretta 418 but having neglected to maintain the gun for many years only succeeded in blowing his own hand off . '' <newline> Emanuels heart sunk beneath his feet , down so far they might have caught a glimpse of the spinning mass at our planets core . It was so specific , so exact that logical reasoning would not permeate the racing neurons in his brain . Illogical conclusions began to flood , ones first of being in a dream or a coma . Lucid dreaming had been a hobby of Emanuel 's , an attempt to control eight hours with tales of chivalry or utter cruelty . He knew he was not dreaming . Had this man read his body language and guessed ? No , he knows the gun model . Had he read my mind ? <newline> The old man leaned down to touch the pavement the way a shipwrecked sailor touches the sand . Holding back tears"

Little did I know that only a few days later I would watch life disappear from her eyes as doctors pulled the bloody infant out of her belly . `` Watch out , she 's a biter ! '' a female doctor shouted as they laid her on a table . She had a full set of perfect teeth that would 've been white if they had n't been covered in blood . <newline> <newline> As wildly different genetic alterations became the norm after the incident of 2018 , children were required to be named after their special traits no later than at the age of five . At that point the traits would be apparent and for public safety they would have to be identifiable from a child 's name . After all , you could n't name your kid Latin Expert before they could speak . <newline> <newline> My wife and I had planned to name our daughter Laura until she would have to be renamed . But as our offspring 's `` special ability '' was obvious from the get-go , in my resentment of her I immediately named her Bites People . Naming her Laura would have only reminded me of the fact that my wife was n't there to raise our child with me . <newline> <newline> For a long time I struggled to come to terms with Bites People 's tendency to , well , bite people . `` Put a muzzle on her ! '' other parents would tell me as I heard about yet another incident at daycare . In time she would get better at controlling her urges , but I knew she 'd always be biting people . I also knew they 'd be coming after her , just like they came after everyone that was deemed to be a danger to society . But I would deal with it when the day would come . She was my kid , my responsibility . And if someone would try to take her away from me ? This time , they would bite it ."

    "target": "In my favorite life , I lived in a castle . Not a dreary actual-fortification kind of castle with arrow slits for windows , but a beautiful , honest-to-God fairytale castle with brightly-painted towers and stained glass windows . Every morning I would wake up in my room at the top of one of those towers . The sunlight would fall on my face in many-colored patterns , and the smell of freshly-baked sweetcakes would greet me from my bedside table . There was always a set of clothes laid out at the foot of the bed . <newline> <newline> The castle and the countryside were mine to explore . Some days , I wandered through the castle , knowing the layout by heart and yet somehow always finding new rooms containing new wonders , even though I had wandered the castle 's halls on thousands of other days . Other days , I explored the countryside . Rolling green hills seemed to go on infinitely beneath an always-perfect blue sky . Streams flowed down those hills into shady groves of trees . <newline> <newline> But eventually , the sun would begin to wane , and I would begin to grow tired . I became apprehensive as the lengthening shadows of the trees or the furniture seemed to want to reach out and grab me . But I knew that I would always be safe in my tower room , so I would go there , and eventually fall asleep in my bed . <newline> <newline> In my not-so-favorite life , I lived in the other castle . At least , I assumed it was a castle . The dungeon of a castle , to be specific . The walls were not stone , like my real home , but a drab off-white plaster of some kind . The single door was made of dully-reflective metal , with a thick window that contained a crosshatched wire . The door was strong ; I could never open it . I wore simple clothes of the same off-white color as the walls . <newline> <newline> It was always dark in this castle , and that scared me . There was one window in my room , at least , and I could look out without having to leave the safety of my bed . The window overlooked a lake ; I would watch the water for hours . The water would move in predictable , orderly patterns , and I would slowly become less afraid . Sometimes it was clear and I could see the stars , which always made me happy . Sometimes , it was cloudy , and I could n't see anything . Those nights were long . Sometimes , it would storm , and rain and wind would slam into my window , and I would curl up tighter in my bed and cry and wish I could just fall asleep and go back home . <newline> <newline> On nights when I could see , after hours of looking out the window , the horizon would begin to lighten and I would stretch and strain against my tiredness to stay awake , and almost stay awake long enough to see the sun , but inevitably , I fell asleep and returned to my tower room . <newline> <newline> Still other nights , maybe one in five , I would have a visitor . A face would appear in the crosshatched window , watch me for a minute , then the door would open . The man would walk in and spin around my room 's one chair to face me and sit down . He always wore loosely fitting blue clothes and carried a stack of papers . I would never move from my curled-up position on my bed , and he would always smile at me , as if waiting for something . <newline> <newline> `` I 've been thinking about what you told me about the tower , '' he said , his voice low and steady . `` You told me that it 's better there because it 's always light , right ? '' <newline> <newline> I nodded . <newline> <newline> `` And it 's always dark here ? '' He asked , looking into my eyes . <newline> <newline> I hunched down more and nodded again . Tonight was a clear night , and the stars were out , and the sky was beginning to get lighter , and I wished he would just go away . Maybe this time I could stay awake , if I really tried . <newline> <newline> He sighed . `` You know , I 've told you before that you would eventually have to choose . That choice is entirely up to you to make . But I have one question for you , my friend . '' <newline> <newline> He paused until I looked up at his face again . <newline> <newline> `` Would you rather stay in a place where you are always afraid of the night ? Or would you rather stay in a place where you are always looking forward to the dawn ? '' <newline>"

I felt wonderful . <newline> <newline> “ Can I get you more coffee , Paul ? ” <newline> <newline> Turning my beatific smile toward Leonie , I simply shook my head , basking in the glory of her beautiful answering smile . <newline> <newline> I could hear the morning greetings of dozens of birds in the garden , their cheerful twittering coming in the open window . And through the window , through the dancing lacy curtains , the soft colour of the dawn sky . <newline> <newline> How long had it been since I had been up at dawn and sober and so happy ? Awake at dawn , easy . Sober ? Not likely , and happy ? Well , forget it . Not worth trying to remember . <newline> <newline> Leonie rose and took our plates and mugs away , and I felt relaxed enough to just sit and watch as she rinsed and stacked the crockery , humming quietly to herself as she worked . <newline> <newline> I marvelled at the strange turn of events of the night . Who would have thought that a drunken call of a phone sex line would have turned out this way ? I chuckled now as I thought about that first few moments on the line . <newline> <newline> “ Tell me what you want to do with me , ” the breathy voice on the phone had said , but something had made me pause . This was a voice I knew ! “ Or should I tell you what I want to do with you ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Um… Is this… Is this Leonie ? ” I had asked , nervous and feeling like a complete twat . Nobody would own up anyway , and if she DID , then , that ’ d mean I ’ D have to own up to making this xxx call ! Very stupid , really . <newline> <newline> “ Who is this ? ” she instantly demanded , all traces of sex gone from her voice . <newline> <newline> “ Er , it ’ s Paul. ” <newline> <newline> “ Paul ? ” I could see her jaw dropping as if she were in the room with me . “ My… next door neighbour , Paul ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah. ” <newline> <newline> “ Um… ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah… ” <newline> <newline> “ So . Paul . You ’ re drunk , huh ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah . And Leonie . You ’ re a phone sex worker , huh ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Yeah. ” <newline> <newline> And then , somehow , miraculously , the woman had hung up the phone ( thank god because those calls cost a fortune ! ) and had turned up on his doorstep in a cute green dress , with an old-fashioned picnic basket slung over her arm . And on her glowing face , a smile worth dying for . <newline> <newline> Her advertisement had promised a good time , but the night had turned into not only a good time , but the best night of my life . Sprawling on the rug before the fire , playing silly card games I hadn ’ t played since I was a kid , eating the wonderful things she baked herself , talking and talking and talking . <newline> <newline> Finally being forced by hunger from the bubble we had created , we ’ d come into the kitchen , where again , she cooked . A wonderful breakfast of pancakes and fruit and then a steaming pot of freshly ground and brewed coffee ; the kitchen came to life , using this vision for a beating heart . <newline> <newline> I brought myself back to the present moment and stared at the woman I had seen in the yard beside mine for years , never thinking much of . She was merely my neighbour , and I merely a self-absorbed twat . Quite often a drunk twat . I shook my head , smiling , beaming ! <newline> <newline> What a woman ! What a night ! <newline>"

A bead of sweat slowly trickled down my forehead , and I struggled to regain my breath , desperately sucking in air while my head throbbed with pain . <newline> <newline> In front of me , the pale corpse that had tried to eat my brains , laid upon the grass in a twisted heap . Her crushed head and broken neck had swung backwards , and had been pinned underneath her withering body as she had fallen to the ground . Now her gnashing teeth were no longer snapping at me , I stood up and slowly shuffled forward for a better look . <newline> <newline> As I came within reach of the zombie 's legs , I kicked her shoe , to check for a sign of life . Observing none , I stepped around to take in a full view of the dead woman ; the sight of it evoked the image of a dead deer in a black-and-white movie , with her pallid skin tone , a tattered , dirty brown fur coat partially covering her upper body , muddy and worn-out black shoes giving the impression of hooves . She looked frail , and old , despite her startling speed and vice-grip strength that had been exhibited when she had chased me out of the pathology lab I had been sitting in . Luckily that spade had been leaning against a house out in the open , or ... <newline> <newline> The sudden realisation of what had happened , what I had been caught up in , made me retreat to my inner sanctuary , the place where my thoughts and fantasies collided . Had I really been attacked by , and killed , a zombie ? When faced with life or death , had I survived by using my own wits , or through dumb luck ? I was feeling more tired and jaded as every question tumbled over and over in my mind . <newline> <newline> Just as a feeling of catatonia was beginning to descend over my shoulders and into my chest , the rapidly approaching sounds of sirens broke the spell . Upon realising that I had sunk to my knees next to the zombie , I snapped into a tall stance , and spun around . The sirens were blaring from three police cars , lights flashing and wheels screeching as they rounded the corner at the end of the street . <newline> <newline> My first thought was , thank goodness - and I began to slowly walk towards the vehicles , who all stopped suddenly in the middle of the lane . A nagging feeling started pulling at my collar , accompanied by confusion and a hint of dread . <newline> <newline> The passenger side front door on the closest car swung open first , and a police officer sprung out , pistol in hand and pointed at my head . Four more officers from the other two cars immediately did the same thing , and the driver of the closest car climbed out with a megaphone in hand . My hands automatically went out in front of me , palms facing the cars . *They think you killed her* , I thought for a moment - and my heart began to race , as the reality of the situation dawned on me . <newline> <newline> ** '' HANDS ON YOUR HEAD , AND DOWN ON YOUR KNEES ! ! ! `` ** shouted the megaphone-wielding officer in the foremost car , and the officers moved out from behind their car doors , guns still trained on me . All of them walked towards me , and the man furthest to the right reached behind his back to grab a pair of handcuffs , all while shuffling closer to me . I meekly submitted , dropping to my knees with my fingers interlocked behind my head . The coarse stones of the driveway I had stopped upon , stabbed into my knees , and I winced from the pain . <newline> <newline> The officers closed the rest of the distance at a jog , and the handcuff-wielding officer quickly attached the cuffs to my left arm . He grabbed my arms , twisted them down firmly , and completed the cuffing . Once that was done , they all bolstered their weapon , and tears began to form in my eyes - I could n't hold on , as the gravity of what was happening started sinking in . <newline> <newline> The final officer , who had dispensed with his megaphone , walked up to me as two of the policemen lifted me to my feet . His face was like black thunder , a sharp , dark , twisted stone facade that showed the hard and horrifying life he had been living , as well as the pity and revulsion he clearly held for me . <newline> <newline> He kept it simple , in a tone that sounded like how his face looked - thunderous . <newline> <newline> `` You are under arrest , for the murder of Betty White .

And every time I did this , I thought to myself with an imaginary fist pump , `` Juked ! '' <newline> <newline> It probably noticed me but continued onward anyway . Slowly , towards an abandoned parking lot , which was barely used even in its heyday , but now laid in a state of discard and disrepair . A few trees had somehow taken root in the worn out cracks of the old cement and concrete surface , brute forcing their way out of the black asphalt in a startlingly violent manner . How did it even grow here ? <newline> <newline> It was then that I noticed , through the tiny gaps in the leafy cape that formed the canopy , the blueish black sky that spoke quietly of the night 's arrival . I had gotten too caught up in following the cat . Speaking of which - <newline> <newline> The cat was not too far from where I was , having continued its agonizingly slow pace . It walked up to some odd machine - wait , is that a spaceship ? - I thought with a great amount of disbelief . I wo n't lie , I really had to take a moment and think just how much I had smoked in the afternoon to be seeing a *spaceship* in broad day - well , night-darkness but it might as well have been daylight for the cats . I had thought the cats were being unusually industrious lately ; I just never thought they had an aerospace industry of some sort . <newline> <newline> The brownish cat squatted beside the spaceship and seemed to take a shit . It must have been some severe constipation but eventually , a dry bag of screws came out . Ironically , the cat was n't rusty at keeping the metal screws clean . It licked itself clean afterwards and then stared right at me with glazed eyes that hinted at sentient arrogance . <newline> <newline> I did n't stay around to watch after that . Yes , I outran a genius cat and his companions all the way back home . It was a close and tough fight , filled with all the exciting twists and turns you might expect from a show like Game of Thrones . But I made it . I escaped the cats . <newline> <newline> Seriously , how much weed did I smoke this afternoon ?"

Her mother protested , but she did not listen . Her father shook her head , but it did n't matter .

She put on a leather jerkin and her father 's over-sized pants , and she left the house . <newline> <newline> In the forest , it snowed gently . Her footsteps were light and the marks were deep , so she could be followed . Soon , a monkey approached her . <newline> <newline> 'Where are you going ? ' said the monkey . <newline> <newline> 'I am going to save my dog , ' said the young woman . <newline> <newline> 'Where is your dog ?

The explanation for you is a part of the whole scheme . <newline> <newline> The Apocalypse . The pure destruction of every living being in existence . That is an idea that would be pretty hard to swallow for those involved . And usually , I would n't want anyone to swallow anything at all . It is in my nature . <newline> <newline> It does feel unfair though . Of course it is supposed to be . We are supposed to exterminate the human race . We bring redundant policies to ensure the accomplishment of our goal . But you know what ? We really do n't need all four of us to succeed . So I think I am going to have a little fun . And although I have n't told the others , and do n't plan to ... I think they will understand , and enjoy . <newline> <newline> A human being can step on a bug . Done . It 's life is over , and there is no coming back . In essence , that is our role , to squash the entirety that is the giant ant pile of human existence . No reasonable resistance , no real way to fight back . Well . Until now of course . <newline> <newline> I have decided to sit on the side lines this apocalypse . Only one of us is really needed anyway . But without my skills involved it will certainly make things exponentially easier . <newline> <newline> Let me explain myself , I can tell you are confused . War for instance . Let 's take that one in to account . The whole world is at war with the combination of persistent pestilence , no food , and constant death . Game over pretty quick all things considered . Lack of food alone has been the downfall of more than one military campaign . <newline> <newline> Pestilence . Sickness . Disease . These are not always death sentences . Especially now with your modern medicine . And again , without food , you feeble immune systems will be practically non-existent , and probably not even let you get manipulated by wars schemes . What fun is it having a bunch of malnourished , sickly barbarians falling dead on the battle field just from walking to far . <newline> <newline> This is all just sad . And sure , global extermination may not be a wonderful thing by the consensus of the human population , but it 's not really your decision , is it ? But here is my point . We have been made for one sole purpose , and with all of us combined , we redfine overkill . I have waited an eternity to watch bags of flesh turn into piles of human leftovers . And most likely in a far too quick of a time frame . <newline> <newline> But let 's say I stand back . I let the people eat . Maybe I even do the opposite of the only mission I have ever known . What if I ensure everyone has a healthy diet , is well fed . What would that do ? <newline> <newline> Would it make them happy ? Sure , briefly , but it would also make their agony prolonged . <newline> <newline> Would it give them hope ? Absolutely , they will think I am on their side , but they 'd be sadly mistaken . <newline> <newline> Would they have a chance of survival ... ? <newline> Getting them to think that is the only reason I have made my decision . So , for the time being , call me Abundance ."

Even hospitals . You know , where people are expected to be weak and die , so they do n't raise suspicion '' <newline> <newline> The Starlet stood up and stared down at her . She was n't smiling anymore . `` I think I 've tired you out , I need to go . Goodbye Wendy , I hope to see you again .

I let myself get carried over to the bar , expecting to see the usual waiter ; a burly man in his 40s wearing the usual faded suit jacket and dark jeans . As I look up , my breath is plucked from my lungs . I are n't greeted by the thinning blond hair and piercing blue eyes I expected , but a girl . Soft hair , brown and untamed cascaded over her shoulders on to the pristine white shirt and onto her bust . Everything seems to be in slow motion as my eyes trace every contour and shape of her body in detail . Unlike me , or any of the other customers , who 's hands are littered with small flecks of white , which was the cost of keeping face in today 's society , she was completely pure . From her head to her toes , not a single blemish on her silk skin . She is the definition of beautiful . Her delicate , porcelain hands clasped together in front of that short black dress , which is formal but still very attractive . Green eyes flicked up with a look of coy and curiosity as a faint smile worked it 's way onto her soft peach lips . I blush . Her voice resonated into my mind , cutting off my thought . Matching her appearance , her words are softly spoken and sweet . The type of voice that reminds you of home . <newline> <newline> `` Hi , my name 's Mei . What are you ordering today , sir '' she asks with enthusiasm . <newline> `` Uh ... a..

There is no number 7 on the menu . <newline> <newline> As soon as the words leave me , her eyes narrow . The persona of before has left her and now , all I can think of is danger . She asks me to follow her in a quick and monotone voice . That voice reminded me of a killer . Her speech and her walking pattern , as she walks through to a separate room is ruthless and efficient . No wasted movement . I follow nervously , almost tripping over myself and take a seat opposite her in the exquisitely decorated room I now find myself in . A square table , wooden and stained dark , separates us . <newline> <newline> `` So Mr.. Hudson . You requested a model 23 , complete organ transplants . You 've transferred 14 million , half of the payment and were ready to begin . '' <newline> <newline> I do n't understand . I 'm panicking . Did she just say organ transplant ? I desperately try to think of a way out of this situation but I 'm distracted by the sight of Mei taking her formal shirt off to reveal a very thin , white top underneath . She looks so damn perfect . I 've gained momentary relief from my panic just by the mere sight of her . That 's when the real Mr Hudson walks in . He is very old and withered , covered in long , deep scars , spiralling across his body . He must be about 80 , and he speaks with a dry , raspy voice . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm here to see Mei '' <newline> <newline> he says almost innocently . Mei walks to meet him and that 's when I see it . A huge , deep purple scar under the thin shirt she 's wearing , swimming from the top of her neck all the way down to the small of her back , and then way past where I can see . She approaches him calmly whispers something in his ear . He raises and eyebrow and they both smile . My sense of danger kicks in again , and adrenaline starts to course through my veins . I get it now . <newline> <newline> `` Now then sir , as you are probably aware , there has been a confusion between you and Mr Hudson here '' she says gesturing to the old man with an open palm . <newline> <newline> She does n't have to tell the truth like the rest of us . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't worry sir . '' She walks towards me with a smile . A smile of malice . <newline> <newline> That 's not her body . <newline> <newline> `` You 're going to be just fine .

Here , on the 18th anniversary of our first breath , our nature manifests itself and separates from our flesh for all to see forever more . <newline> <newline> You see , on our 18th birthdays , down to the minute , a ... change occurs . A portion of our bodies changes instantly , rapidly becoming the animal or being most becoming our personality . The slugs and bottom feeders have familiars that are just that : Slimy , crawling eaters of shit that do nothing but clean the refuse from the boots of mankind . Their slime is worn on their sleeves , and no one ever gives them the time of day . Worse still are the leeches and tics , the ones who actively draw on the resources of their fellow man . While some keep their familiars hidden , I suspect more than one politician has a tapeworm that they do n't want anyone to find out about . <newline> <newline> Some try to kill their familiar , to hide their true nature , or even to simply run away . Of course , such attempts are futile , causing the creature to manifest anew ... which as I was about to find out was NOT a pleasant experience . <newline> <newline> As I woke on my 18th birthday , my belly was full the fire of change . Today was the critical day that would decide my fate . I knew I was better . I am superior than these pitiful people that call themselves my `` family . '' My mother had me before she manifested , calling forth a pitiful mouse . True to her kind , she had another on the way before I was even 2 . And no father to be seen . Of course . <newline> <newline> My little brother was staring at me wide eyed at breakfast . He was only a few years younger than I was , but his naivety was expressed in his every movement . I bet he will be something pitiful . Maybe a deer . If he changes his outlook and becomes a bit more curious maybe he will get a fox . Then , he could at least appear as a predator instead of prey . Not that he could make much of it anyway . <newline> <newline> `` Hi big bro . Are you going to school today ? '' He plaintively asked . <newline> <newline> `` Damn little bro , could your eyes get any bigger ? '' I sneered . `` You are going to end up with one of those little nocturnal monkeys on your shoulder . Or those fish in the deep ocean . You do n't want to have to drag around an oarfish , do you ? '' He was so pitiful . So innocent . So ... useless . Why did I have to be born into this family of weaklings ? <newline> <newline> My mother , 8 months pregnant ( AGAIN ) finally pulled her girth around the doorway from the bedroom . She looked like she wanted to say something about the way I was treating my brother , but could n't work up the courage to put the words together . Damn this place is pitiful . I shot her a sneer and said `` Nah little bro , I 'm not . It 's my 18th , no one has any obligations on their 18th . You know that . '' Dumbass . People like him get chewed up and spit out . `` I 'm gon na hit the town . Got ta live it up with some real folks before I lose my shit . See ya ! '' I twisted my body out of my chair and made a beeline to the door . Like hell I would stay here , or go to a shitty school filled with bottom feeders on a day like today . <newline> <newline> I hit the town running and met with my buds ( most of which were playing hooky to hang with me ) . Everyone knew I was going to be a kind apart from these losers . They just wanted in on the action , front row seats to the sight of a lifetime . We stalked the town , hopping from bar to club and back again . No one here gives a shit about how old you are , so long as you have a line of credit . Hell , my buddy Bob even threw in a free shot or two for my birthday . Not that I would want to spend this evening in a state of anything but buzzed . <newline> <newline>"

He lived on the 66th floor of the Grand Luxury Ulysses , which was n't particularly luxurious or grand when compared to many of the other surrounding skyscraping condominiums . This was a good thing . It allowed him to strive for more in life . In the meantime , the view was fantastic and the lack of a working elevator kept him in exceptional shape . Everyone in the building liked it like this , so the repairmen never saw the need to bother fixing it . <newline> <newline> Jeffrey 's father had passed not long ago . Yesterday been the funeral . He smiled as he looked at the picture of his father that he kept beside the bed . He had always depended on his father . Still , the funeral was a positive experience . He could n't quite figure out why , but there seemed to be a silver lining in putting the whole business behind him and celebrating his father 's life . <newline> <newline> The rain seemed to be letting up . That was the nice thing about storms . They 'd always end , and the sun would always peek through . It was the sort of sight that filled you with hope and happiness . He contemplated this over a cup of coffee that was not as good as other cups of coffee in recent memory , which only made him smile . <newline> <newline> Today was , after all , an important day . It was The Pilgrimmage . <newline> <newline> Jeffrey met Mary outside of apartment building . He greeted her with a smile and she returned it warmly . Already the streets were beginning to fill with people making The Pilgrimmage on foot . <newline> <newline> They walked for hours , greeting people they knew and often being greeted by people they did n't . The entire thing brought everyone together in thanks for what they had . Certainly the lineup outside of The Complex would be long . Perhaps they 'd even stand in it for days . That hardly mattered . <newline> <newline> As people filed in to the massive Complex standing shoulder to shoulder five wide , they were invited down whitewash hallways by attendants wearing special hospital gowns . These people were here to look after the health and wellbeing of The Chosen . The Complex was massive , able to see to The Chosen 's every possible need . It provided or activities , adventure , comfort , meals – but it , of course , was still prison-like and always in lockdown except on the day of The Pilgrimmage . <newline> <newline> Today was certainly different . Jeffrey and Mary made their way through the long corridors with the rest of the smiling pilgrims until they came upon a windowed door in a final darkened hallway . A gentle , calming music played through speakers in the ceiling . Each pilgrim would pause at the door , say a quiet prayer , then turn around and leave . Jeffrey approached the door and peered inside . <newline> <newline> Thick , padded walls . No objects . Simply a frail , skeleton of a man with a grey , haggard face and wide , bloodshot eyes sitting in the corner confined by a straightjacket . A mess of blood and hair in the midle of the floor where , even in here , it had somehow managed to injure itself . It looked straight into Jeffrey 's eyes , and opened his gagged , bloody mouth as if to let loose a terrible scream . But it could n't . The Chosen had , many years ago , become the sole receptacle of all negative emotion . Clearly it was too much for any mind to handle , and it had been twisted and tortured beyond insanity . Its head slumped momentarily , but before long a new frenzied struggle against the confinement of the straight jacket began in vain . <newline> <newline> Jeffrey felt a soft hand on his shoulder . He turned to see Mary standing beside him with a smile on her face . He smiled back . <newline> <newline> It was , after all , a beautiful day ."

My first thoughts were hitting up my Xbox 360 for some online play , but glancing across the room at the controller , even that felt like too much work . I was about to get up and pee , when my phone began to ring . It was my older sister , Jennifer . <newline> <newline> She was the only one who knew about my current situation . Ever since we were kids , I was always able to open up to her . She always knew how to get me to talk when I isolated myself in my room , and I always looked up to her . She had moved away to another city after graduating college , but we still stayed in contact on Facebook and texted each other . When she did not hear from me for a while , she called , and as always got the truth out of me . As time went on though , I began avoiding her calls as well , especially as things grew worse . <newline> <newline> I had maybe enough money in the bank to cover one more month of rent before I had to relent and call my parents , explaining all that had happened . As far as they knew , everything was going great for me . I had not had the heart to tell them that I had failed to pass any of my finals , or that the landscaping company I had been working for part time collapsed . <newline> <newline> At first I told myself that everything would be alright . That I would find another job , and that if I changed schools , maybe I could start over .

Another month after that and I was only leaving the apartment for quick , late night runs to the 24-hour grocery down the street . <newline> <newline> The few friends that I had were too busy with their own lives to really notice what was happening . I had always been a bit quiet and withdrawn , so when I stopped showing up to parties , I don ’ t think anyone really noticed . They would occasionally text me to see what was up , or enquire about grabbing a meal sometime , but I always politely brushed them off by saying I was too busy and maybe we could try again another time . Eventually the messages stopped coming . I didn ’ t want to burden them with my problems , or be a downer in their lives , which so far as I could tell , were going great . <newline> <newline> The phone continued to ring . <newline> <newline> Sighing , I glanced from the Xbox 360 to the phone , and picked it up . <newline> <newline> I ’ m glad I did . We talked for hours , and she explained to me that she loved me , and that no matter how bad things got , we could fix them . If worse came to worse , I could crash on her couch and we could figure out some way to solve the school problem . No matter what happened , she would help support me . All I needed to do was take the first steps to help myself . <newline> <newline> It wasn ’ t much , but it meant the world to me . <newline> <newline> She was killed later that evening , when her vehicle was struck by a drunk driver . I was heartbroken , but what she told me stuck with me . Slowly I began to repair my broken life – I found a job and started to go back to school . Now I have my degree and decent job .

Once it was known exactly what those thin points of light in the night sky actually were , that each one could hold other planets capable of life , people began to imagine that maybe , actually , we weren ’ t alone . It was theorised that any life form that became significantly advanced would have nothing but peace on its mind . <newline> The resources needed to travel the stars , and indeed the cooperation needed just to become a civilisation in the first place , should mean that species unable to cooperate peacefully would not be able to advance beyond simple tools . <newline> <newline> Which was why it was particularly distressing when we received the first , and only , extra-terrestrial response to our innocent probing . The transmission was received in two parts . The first was an unintelligible radio signal , being as it was in their own language , and experts puzzled over it for months before an object appeared in the sky . It was brightly lit and orbited the earth for three days , apparently openly sending signals back to the same point of space as the radio transmission had originated . Eventually it entered the atmosphere and crash landed in the middle of London . It stood motionless for some time in a pit of its own creation , and then it released a blast from an unknown weapon type . It destroyed every structure within a five mile radius . The type of blast was completely unknown . What we do know is that while it destroyed every building , it didn ’ t directly kill a single living thing . People were , of course , killed by collapsing buildings and flying debris , but before it had fired its unique weapon a crowd of maybe two-hundred people had gathered around it . Not one of those people died from the blast . <newline> Then it began to transmit to us . It said , in the crudest translation , that technology was forbidden , that cities were forbidden and that resistance was forbidden . It told us , in a harsh approximation of a human voice , that when the first Lander came in six months , this was where it would land . It went on for some time . It told us that we would be food and slaves . It didn ’ t say this just to the British , of course , it told the whole world . It transmitted in each region ’ s language , and it told us to surrender . <newline> <newline> Surrendering , of course , wasn ’ t what was on most people ’ s minds . The first thing most nations did , rather embarrassingly , was to recall any and all troops on foreign soil . Countries all over the world were pretty short on offerings to deal with the probe , preferring instead to prepare for the coming of the promised Landers . <newline> Bizarrely , life carried on almost like normal , at first . Rationing started up pretty quickly , and the government took ownership of all food stores around the country . Army personnel were despatched to protect these places with orders to shoot to kill . Martial law came into effect , and people went to work like they had before . The general consensus was that everything would be okay . <newline> <newline> The military started a major recruitment campaign , and indeed did very well out of it . A few times they attempted to destroy the probe with no success . It would occasionally openly transmit data about troop placements , and it would receive information back in the same garbled tongue that was their language . It appeared to know all , yet did nothing to stop any of it . Once it transmitted that huge numbers of tanks had been drawing closer to it , and that an airstrike was scheduled for later that day . <newline> The fact that it knew this information and didn ’ t bother encrypting its transmissions , or indeed bother to respond to the various military attacks , unnerved a lot of people . As time of the first Lander drew closer , people began to get worried . They started stockpiling food and fuel . There was a mass exodus to the countryside , as it was generally believed that cities would be attacked first . The government had started to rank people by importance to society . Some were even taken to secret facilities for safety . The police could no longer handle the amount of disruption as people were spread out across the countryside , and the military were called in to police the insufficiently covered areas . <newline> <newline> Crime rose sharply as people encroached onto other ’ s lands , and weapon laws were relaxed to allow the general population to own handguns . It was believed that when the aliens attacked , people should be allowed to fend for themselves . What actually started to happen was the formation of gangs .

It was n't just that he would leave his empty soda cans lying everywhere , the table , the floor , even the sink for some reason , or the crumbs that he left sprayed over the ground . It was n't his whining , nasal voice . No . It was his smug , self-centered attitude . Nothing was ever his fault . The mess was always `` someone else . '' Any conversation , on any topic , and magically he became an expert . And god forbid if you dared to disagree . He 'd go on and on in that whining drone of his , not shutting up until you just gave up and let him keep his stupid , self-absorbed opinions . <newline> <newline> God , I hate him so , so much .

We started to wonder after he had n't returned by the next day . But honestly , we just did not care enough to try and figure out where he was . <newline> <newline> That is , until the police came . They told us the news . He had been found dead in an alleyway near our house , a bullet in his head . Someone had clumsily tried to make it look like suicide , but there were other fingerprints on the gun , and it was in his right hand although normally he used his left . <newline> <newline> I did n't care . He was out of our lives . Thank god . Unfortunately for me , I had made no secret of how much I had hated him , and the police politely asked me to accompany them to the station .

He pulled out the gun , you two struggled , he got shot . You panicked , put the gun in his hand and ran . Tell that to a judge , and with any luck you 'll only have to do a few years . Hell , keep your nose clean and you 'll get out even sooner . '' <newline> <newline> `` No . '' My voice was a hoarse whisper . After they had charged me , I had screamed obscenities and curses at the policemen . I felt bad about that now . They were just doing their jobs . I took a swig of water , and said it again . `` No . I did n't kill him . I 'm innocent , and I want to prove it . '' The lawyer shook his head and sighed . <newline> <newline> `` Alright . But you know what that means , right ? '' <newline> <newline> My skin crawled . `` Reanimation . '' We could bring back the dead , to testify at their trials .

Two right shoes , one of them not fitting . <newline> <newline> `` They wo n't fucking let me into 7-11 , I have n't had a cigarette all god damn day . '' <newline> <newline> This was true -- 7-11 had already closed 249 stores in the past 3 months , due to their strict `` No shoes , no service . '' policy . They had refused to change the policy , the CEO quoted as saying the `` outstanding integrity of our policies is immeasurably valuable '' and `` We believe in the American dream , and that dream involves matching shoes. '' . <newline> <newline> Jed was talking to the right shoe on his left foot . Jed was very angry . <newline> <newline> **Three months prior** - <newline> President Obama had passed congress 's bill to `` increase the value of all left shoes by 20,000 % '' , on April 1st 2014 . The same day , during a presidential speech on environmental ethics at the University of Wisconsin , Obama took a gunshot to his left temple . The shooter 's name was Joji Iokana , a Korean exchange student studying to be a mechanical engineer . He had been promptly killed seconds after firing the shot at the U.S. president . It was later found out that Joji Iokana was a severely deranged individual , who had trended incredibly high on the autism spectrum . This resulted in the exchange student never actually understanding any jokes and `` reacting violently when facing sarcasm '' said Judy Iokana , his mother . The announcement to veto and destroy the bill was set for only two hours after the U.S. president had died , but never actually happened . Now , this is where congress had fucked up very badly , because they thought it would be extra funny to add a clause to the Constitution of the United States stating that the bill would `` only be destroyable by the 2014 president of the United States of America '' . Due to the immense difficulty it is to remove a clause from the constitution , congress was stuck in a tough spot even three months later , with nearly no progress made to reform the clause . The bill survived , and the United States was in an extreme state of class separation . People sold their left shoes to the rich , who hoarded them all . People stole left shoes from each other , while the rich laughed . People killed other people for their left shoes , and other people would kill those people , and so on . Even shoes in other countries became scarce , as the poor would sell their left shoes to the rich people of their homeland , who would sell them to rich men in the United States for an enormous profit . <newline> <newline> Jed threw his shoe , which was a red and nameless knock-off with white laces , at the television set . <newline> <newline> `` Today 's story , the new Yeezy-boost 63-6281 's now cost 30,000,000usd per left shoe , and 1,500 per right . In a recent interview with rapper Kanye West , he was quoted as saying 'YALL NIGGAS CA N'T FUCK WITH 'YE , YALL NIGGAS CA N'T FUCK WITH 'YE ' and 'JEROME 'S IN THE HOUSE WATCH YOUR MOUTH , JEROME 'S IN THE HOUSE WATCH YOUR MOUTH ' when asked about why he had not taken a stand against congress 's cruel decision to up shoe prices . '' <newline> <newline> I could n't stand it any longer , I could n't stand Jed and his anger , I could n't stand the television . I went out into the front yard and sat in the rough summer grass . I sat until I left a indent of my body 's lower half . I cried all night , I could n't sleep well ever since the thoughts started . What was the point of it all ? All the deadbolts on our front door ? For what , to protect the shoes we did n't have ? <newline> <newline> I got out of bed . I looked at Jed , his face was relaxed and he perspired like he always had done in his sleep . I snuck into the kitchen , I found the loaded Kimber 45 Jed had kept under the sink in case of another home invasion . I went out onto the patio and stared into the sky , something was strangely different about tonight . The stars were n't any bigger , and the moon was n't special in any particular way . The clouds swirled in the night sky of Goyang , creating a fusion of purple and blue . It was beautiful . But I knew there was nothing to it . I brought the pistol up to my right temple , I counted down from three . I knew that I would see my son again ."

I drag the mobile along with my foot until it reaches my free hand ; I thumb the digits and stop before I press the last number . What was I to say , what could I possibly say that could change this ? In despair I sink my forehead into the butt of the phone and as I do I catch a glance at the phone number written on the back of my hand . 0800-2677 , who the hell does this belong to ? Out of curiosity I call the number . <newline> <newline> ‘ Ello , Charlie here from epiphany hotlines , if we can ’ t answer it ; no one can .

And with that , I thought of the perfect question . <newline> <newline> ‘ How do I win my girlfriend back ? I don ’ t know how to do it any more , I ’ ve tried everything , and I can ’ t think of life without her , I feel we ’ re meant to be , but we just keep going back and forth - ’ <newline> <newline> ‘ Woah , woah , woah simmer down their sparky , let me answer .

My heart rate rises , the sweat pours and my colon cramps once again . I needed those pills even if it killed me , but they are still out of my reach . The closest item beside me was the butcher ’ s knife . I hold it in my left hand and look at my shackled right hand . <newline> <newline> In hindsight , I probably took Charlie ’ s advice too literally . <newline>"

    "target": "Rancho Cucamonga was a crappy suburb in L.A. filled with ranch style homes that have 5 digit address numbers . It has strip malls , a downtown , and plenty of parking everywhere you look . Like most L.A. suburbs , it has its share of crime , but what sets Rancho Cucamunga apart is that it has its very own self-proclaimed super villain . He called himself The Heretic and he terrorizes the town by robbing liquor stores and marijuana dispensaries . He and his henchmen also like to tear through the neighborhood on their loud cars and set off other people 's car alarms . The Heretic wore a dark costume with a black cape and a pointed hood . He and his henchmen liked to wear a big `` H '' on their chest . <newline> <newline> The Heretic 's criminal activity is kept in check by a fellow with the name of Midnight Skunk , who was Rancho Cucamonga 's resident super hero . Midnight Skunk was one of these heroes that did n't really have any superpowers , other than being in really good shape and doing all sorts of martial arts . He did at one point have the ability to spray a foul odor out of the tail of his costume , but some residents complained and he had to drop it . He still likes the tail , however , and wears it with his black and white costume when he fights crime . <newline> <newline> These two have been feuding for almost 5 years when it was suddenly brought to a tragic end . It happened one day when The Heretic and his crew were trying to rob a marijuana dispensary for the drugs and the money . There were five of them ; The Heretic brought along 4 men as backup . Three of his men had been long time associates but the fourth man was brand new . The new guy was not allowed to carry a gun and was supposed to be the get away driver . He waited outside while the robbery was going down . <newline> <newline> Inside the dispensary , The Heretic had all the customers and workers tied up with duct tape . His three henchmen were looting the place . As The Heretic began to gloat and terrorize the hostages , in jumps the Midnight Skunk ! <newline> <newline> `` Fear not , citizens ! It is I , the Midnight Skunk here to rescue you ! '' the superhero said . He began fighting with The Heretic 's men . The Heretic was a small man who was no good in fights . He stood back and gathered the money and loot . Somehow , Midnight Skunk was able to get a jump on all three of his henchmen and disarm them before they could get a single shot off . The terrified hostages looked on with amazement . As they kept fighting , The Heretic made his way to the getaway vehicle . <newline> <newline> As he approached the door , he saw his fourth henchmen approaching . <newline> <newline> `` Are you alright , boss ? '' he said . `` I saw the Midnight Skunk ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Get back in the car ! '' The Heretic said , `` I told you to stay in there ! '' <newline> <newline> Just then the fight between Midnight Skunk and The Heretic 's henchmen spilled onto the street . The fourth henchman reached into his pants and brought out a 9mm pistol . He fired two shots at the Midnight Skunk and hit him in the chest and stomach . The Midnight Skunk screamed , dropped , and did not get back up again . The other three henchmen were stunned . <newline> <newline> `` You fool ! '' The Heretic said , `` Get in the car and get out of here now ! '' <newline> <newline> They all escaped in their getaway vehicle and did not stop until they were back in their hideout . All during the drive , The Heretic did n't say a word . He remained silent until they were sure no one was following them . <newline> <newline> `` You were n't supposed to have a gun ! '' The Heretic said . <newline> <newline> `` What ? I thought you 'd be happy ! I finally got that Skunk ! '' the new henchman said . <newline> <newline> The other henchmen looked down and The Heretic sighed . He began to explain to the new henchman why he was so upset . As it turns out , The Heretic and Midnight Skunk had been cooperating . Each time Midnight Skunk stopped one of The Heretic 's robberies , they would put on a fight , but Midnight Skunk would always let the criminals get away . In exchange , The Heretic and his men would not hurt the superhero and this allowed Midnight Skunk to keep fighting crime and selling his action figures . It was beneficial for both because the police generally stayed out of their feud . Now , everything was ruined . <newline> <newline> The Heretic pulled out revolver from his holster and pointed it at the new henchman . The others did the same with their guns . <newline> <newline> `` Wait , please , I 'm sorry , please give me another chance ! I 'll do anything ! '' the man begged . <newline> <newline> `` Anything ? '' The Heretic said . `` We need a new Midnight Skunk . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh ... Okay ... '' the man said . A look of hope entered his eyes . <newline> <newline> `` Hmm ... . yes , maybe you can be the new superhero in our little arrangement '' The Heretic said . `` We got ta think of a name"

    "target": "At exactly 3:32 PM on a regular old Tuesday in a regular old house on a regular old street , there was a thud that broke the boring and empty silence . This alarming sound was promptly proceeded by a series of scampering thuds , which to Albert Tinney sounded suspiciously like the footfalls of children . *Odd* , Albert thought , *I don ’ t have any children* . <newline> <newline> With a sigh and a grumble , Albert threw off his bedsheet , swung his feet out of bed and toed them into his bunny slippers . *Better not be that damned cat again* , Albert continued thinking , *or I ’ ll give it the boot . I don ’ t care what Miss Alice says* . <newline> <newline> Miss Alice was Alice Wendy , Albert ’ s neighbor and she lived with a number of cats . One cat in particular did not fancy its owner much and would continually try to break out of her house and into his . It wasn ’ t that they liked each other very much , the cat and Albert , but they did have one thing very much in common : they loved nothing more than the quiet of solitude . <newline> <newline> On many an afternoon , Al would come downstairs for a glass of milk only to find the cat curled up in the window nook above the front door . When the realtor had sold him this particular condo , he had been in quite a hurry and hadn ’ t been listening when the realtor had chimed in about the previous owner ’ s having had a pet cat — one which loved to sit and bask in the sun in its favorite spot . <newline> <newline> The trouble was , as Al soon found out , there was no cat to be found . He looked in the usual spots , upstairs and down , the beast would choose to laze around , but came up empty . *One day , I ’ m going to find out how that beast finds its way in and that ’ ll be the end of that* , he thought , nodding assuredly to himself . <newline> <newline> Then he heard it again , and froze where he stood . *Thump-thump-thump* His eyes narrowed as he climbed the stairs toward the sound . *Got you now , beastie , * he thought , smiling to himself . At the top of the stairs , he grabbed the empty laundry basket he kept near the linen cupboard . <newline> <newline> *Thump-thump-thump-thump* <newline> <newline> It was in the guest room . Of that , he was sure . On feet whisper-quiet in their tread , he crept toward the guest room door which was cracked open . Albert always kept the doors in his house closed . He found silence was easier to maintain this way . A door opened a crack should have signaled to him that something else might have been going on , because as any human with half a brain knows , only the smartest of cats know how to turn a door knob . If only Albert had been blessed with half the wit of a normal man . <newline> <newline> He held the laundry basket upside-down in one hand , ready to plop it down on an unwelcomed feline visitor , and reached for the door with the other . Not wanting to spend a beautifully boring afternoon trapsing through his house chasing after some beast , Albert wanted to get this over with nice and quick . <newline> <newline> As he reached for the door , ready to whip it open , he heard the thumps again — this time heading toward the door and he nimbly backed out of the way , careful not to bump anything and clamped his hand over his mouth as *something* — though he wasn ’ t sure what — whipped open the door and thudded its way down the hall toward his bedroom . <newline> <newline> The only trouble was that the thing wasn ’ t a *thing* at all . In fact , there didn ’ t seem to be anything there . Albert would have thought himself imagining all this nonsense if only there weren ’ t the little footprints in the dust . He noticed them now . They were partially obscured by the sweeping steps of his bunny slippers , but he was grateful now for the fact that he only dusted on odd Sundays . <newline> <newline> Oddly , the footsteps led into three rooms now and seemed to begin in the middle of the hallway as if out of no where . Albert frowned down at the footprints but decided not to make his brain hurt with plausibilities . Instead , he decided he should go in after it and try to catch it . He stood listening for a moment and heard the quick little steps of the thing in his room . Careful to close the guestroom door , he padded his way toward his bedroom door which also now stood ajar . <newline> <newline> Albert pushed gently on the door and it swung soundlessly open . Looking around , he saw nothing but remembered the beastie was invisible — at least for the moment — and thought to look down at its tracks . He followed them , his laundry basket in tow , one at a time until he came to the edge of his bed where they seemed to disappear underneath . <newline> <newline> As he was about to lean down to get a better look at things under the bed , a light bulb went off . *Best not expose my face . I ’ ll catch the bugger when it saunters out , * he thought and smirked to himself ."

The only light emits from the monitor , reflecting off the man 's black rimmed glasses , which showed a counter dropping in seconds . A list of names filled the left side of the screen in a single column . The counter was nearing 0 . The man sat up in his seat a little more . He holds his hand over a button sitting in front of the screen . He watches closely as the number counts down . 3..2..1 ... <newline> <newline> As soon as the counter reaches 1 , a quiet *ding* rings from the computer 's speakers . The counter resets at 60 and begins counting down again . The names on the left move down one . The man relaxes in his seat . He blinks twice , rapidly , bringing up information on his glass lenses . The time reads 5:59 A.M . He turns and looks behind him to a door on the opposite wall as if he were anticipating it to open . <newline> <newline> The counter drifts close to 0 again , causing the man to turn back to the monitor . Moments after the *ding* fills the room again , the door opened . <newline> <newline> `` It 's not like you to be late Sam '' said the man to the figure entering the room . The figure takes a step forward , stepping into the light of the computer , revealing a young , light skinned man . The monitor made his short black hair appear blue in the light . <newline> The man appears surprised . `` Oh sorry , you 're not Sam . '' <newline> <newline> `` No worries , I 'm Anthony . Sam called in sick today , '' Anthony replies , smiling . <newline> The man stands up immediately and holds out his hand . `` Sorry sir , I did n't realize it was you .

'' <newline> <newline> Anthony walks over and sits in the chair . The counter is passing 5 sec . Alex tenses up as it approaches 0 .

'' Anthony asks , watching the counter . <newline> <newline> Alex steps next to Anthony . `` What do you mean ? Did we really have a choice ? '' <newline> <newline> Anthony continues to stare intensively at the counter . `` You 're right . We were the top pressers back in cycle 0 . Playing a stupid game , just hoping to be the one to press it at one sec . '' <newline> <newline> Alex turns his attention to the counter . `` It was different back then . That game was about resisting touching the button until the last moment . '' He looks at the button on the desk . `` Now we have to be ready to press the button to save the world from an early restart . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'll never forget those first few cycles . Chaos . War . Death . Revival ! '' Anthony says , emphasizing the last word . The counter drips to 3 sec . Alex tenses up again just as the *ding* goes off . `` Did you ever die during those times ? '' <newline> <newline> Alex looks at Anthony , his eyes growing serious . `` No , thankfully . I was in an area that did n't go nuts in the first cycle . I was able to find a safe haven which led me to this job . '' <newline> Anthony finally turns away from the counter and stares directly at Alex with a stern look . `` Then answer my first question . Why do you work here ? '' <newline> <newline> Alex takes a step back . `` Oh right , sorry . Well , when the Presser 's organization found me , I took their tests to confirm my pressing time . They determined that I was needed for the job because of my high reaction times . I felt like I had to take the job . Like it was my duty . '' <newline> <newline> Anthony stands up . `` And you chose this eternal hell over an immortal one ? '' Anthony steps closer to Alex . `` You enjoy working in 8 hour rotations , for 15 years until the reset and then finding your way back here to do it again ? Just to sit in one of hundreds of identical rooms ? How can you accept that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Because if it were n't for us , the billions of people out there would n't be able to enjoy theirs . If it were n't for so many groups trying to end cycles early to reset their mistakes , we would n't need this fail safe ! '' <newline> <newline> Anthony drops back into the chair and stares back at the counter . *Ding* . The noise causes Alex to jump . <newline> <newline> `` 8 million users . 59 sec each . 15 years .

Everyone in the class bolted upright suddenly , shocked out of their hot summer afternoon schoolroom stupor at the spectacle of a teacher vanishing into thin air . I was shocked too .

The noise was ear-splitting and I pushed my hands to my ears , mindlessly wishing that she , too , would shut up and just vanish . <newline> <newline> Yeah , you see where this is going . <newline> <newline> The problem was that the more I did it , the more people started to scream and cry and run around in circles .

His legs were bent , bringing his knees towards his chest , while his lower back rested against the wall . The resulting strain pulled his jeans up , exposing his ankles and white socks . If you had just walked up you might ’ ve sworn that Josh was about to drop a beer on to the rug . Somehow the friction of Josh ’ s barely closed hand kept the drink from diving to the ground to spill its sticky contents on to the rug . It was not a beer however . The contents of the bottle were of a more innocent nature . The root beer bottle was nearly empty and only the tiniest of sips remained . His left elbow rested on his knee , with his hand supporting his head . It looked like Josh had been in nearly the same position for hours . It had , in fact , been approximately four hours . On the opposite side of the narrow hall sat Monty . Monty sat in a similar position , though he did not have a drink . <newline> Both of his elbows rested on his knees , pulling them slightly apart . He blankly stared at the wall that Josh was leaning against , lost in thought . Had he not been shirtless , in gym shorts , un-shaven , and needing a haircut he might have looked like a youth-full prophet . Farther down the wall sat Garret . He sat on the same side as Josh . His back was flat against the wall , with his legs outstretched . Garret was shorter than the other two , so his feet fit flat against the wall . He stared down towards the floor , with the same blank expression as the other two . No one could have guessed what the three were thinking of . They had been sitting in the silence for the last thirty minutes or so . <newline> No one wanted to speak . It was peaceful and delicate . So delicate , that the opening of the door next to Garret was enough to break it . The door that opened was to Neal ’ s dorm . He came out in his boxers , squinting at the sudden brightness . Neal glanced down at the trio , and the trio stared back . The awkward boy did his best to close the door quietly and shuffled down the hallway , presumably towards the bathroom . The stillness had been shattered . Monty reached into his baggy shorts and pulled out his phone , checking the time . Monty ignored the forgotten text message he had gotten from his girlfriend hours ago . He turned the phone around to show the other two . 4:03 . They all had classes in the morning and each knew they should ’ ve gone to bed hours ago . <newline> Josh was the next to break the stillness . Using the wall as his support he slowly got up . He looked down at the other two for a brief moment , making eye contact with both . They all understood . Josh slowly turned around and walked away from them . He stumbled ever so slightly , whether from exhaustion or standing up after sitting down for so long . He made it to the end of the hall and pushed the door open , disappearing out of sight into the dark room . Monty and Garret only looked at each other for a split second before following suit . Monty got up quickly and helped Garret up . They quietly walked down the hall , in the opposite direction of Josh . Garret reached his room first and Monty passed him . Each went into their respective rooms . Garret knew he had to be up in three hours . He didn ’ t care . It had been a good night . <newline>"

At times , Jack and Sparkles were allies , cooperating against Jenny to get some delicious human food . Other times , they were merely roommates , not necessarily friend or foe . And yet other times Sparkles was a blood-thirsty spawn from hell with one and only one mission - to claw the ever-loving shit out of Jack 's face . This was the real crux of the problem - not the Sparkles was a known enemy , but that she was totally and utterly unpredictable . <newline> <newline> Sparkles was n't the only cat in the house . Frankie was an older tabby , who had reached the apex of apathy . Jack and Frankie had an understanding , Frankie would always say things like `` We 're cool man . You dig ? '' Jack honestly had no idea what the hell he was talking about , other than that it was positive sentiment . Frankie was infinitely more laid back than Sparkles , but at a certain cost - Frankie had been a heavy catnip user in his youth , making him relaxed but thoroughly demented . <newline> <newline> His moment had come . Jack knew Jenny 's habits well , and when she turned off the TV , he knew that she would be asleep soon . This is it , this was his opportunity . Jack just needed to wait a few minutes for Jenny to be in deep sleep and make sure Sparkles would n't interfere . <newline> <newline> `` Hey Frankie ... Psst , Frankie ! '' Jack whispered from across the living room , but got no response . Frankie was passed out hard on the top of his scratching post . Jack wanted Frankie to be a lookout - he had n't seen Sparkles for hours and worried that she would somehow ruin his plan . <newline> <newline> Jack crossed the room and nudged Frankie with his snout , whispering `` Psst ... Frankie . Get up '' <newline> <newline> `` What is it man , ca n't you see I 'm sleeping ? Killing my dreams man . '' grumbled Frankie . <newline> <newline> `` Frankie , help a brother out - just keep a look out for Sparkles , and shout if she goes towards Jenny 's room OK ? '' urged Jack . `` Can you do that for me ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , whatever man , no sweat . '' mumbled Frankie . He was already one paw back into his dream . <newline> <newline> Shit ... Jack thought , Frankie was going to be no help at all . He felt he was losing his motivation , losing his conviction to go through with his plan . Then he remembered waking up , hazy with drugs , held together with stitches , and ball-less . He shook his head and focused on the task at hand . He made his way to Jenny 's bedroom . <newline> <newline> He was angry . He had a plan . He was ready to kill . Jack started approaching Jenny 's bed , when a moment of panic hit him - there was Sparkles , sitting at Jenny 's feet . She was awake and immediately aware of the fact that Jack was there , and not for cuddles . <newline> <newline> `` Hmm hmm , Jack , what are ya doing there ? Hmm ? '' she said as her eyes twitched . This was one of Sparkles symptoms when she was in one of her batshit crazy moods . `` Still upset about the V-E-T huh ? Hahaha ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Shut up Sparkles ! '' throated Jack , `` You know why I 'm here . I 'm here to kill Jenny , and there 's nothing , nothing you can do to stop me ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , hmm , is that so ? Hmm . I think you 'll have a sudden change of heart in a moment , hmmm '' mocked Sparkles . <newline> <newline> Jack knew it was now or never . He lunged forward , prepared to kill Jenny and Sparkles if he had to . He built up speed for his jump"

    "target": "Count on me to make things complicated . Not your normal 'it 's complicated ' relationship thing , or 'its complicated ' as an excuse for an unsolved sudoku puzzle , but the kind of 'its complicated ' when you have to explain to your parents that you summoned a freaking demon in the middle of math class . My excuse ? I was bored . <newline> <newline> My third period math class had started all of five minutes ago and I was already daydreaming while absently scribbling in my notebook . Usually I would draw animals , or make some flowers , but not today . Some stupid kid had to set his dripping wet water bottle on my notes while he talked to his friends , and I could n't just leave the perfect circle made by water alone . So after telling the owner of the water bottle to do something highly anatomically unlikely , I drew in the lines of the circle myself . And I could n't leave the circle empty , so I started drawing lines . I intended for the lines to be spokes , I could turn this into an old fashioned bike or something , but it turned into some sort of star . `` Ms. Ryans , must you doodle and daydream during my lectures ? It wo n't help you on the test . '' I thought back to dear old Winston Churchill and replied , `` No , it 's purely voluntary . '' Not my best idea . Mr.Darson sighed and said , `` See me after class . '' I tried to pay attention , truly I did , but my pencil wandered back to the paper and the drawing kept becoming more and more detailed until the room went black . No ... it was really a shade of grey , which I soon realized was not my own unconsciousness , but a cloud of smoke and ash . At the center of the ash cloud stood a 'thing ' that looked like a man in a white suit . He looked very annoyed . `` You called ? Look kid , I got work to do , and you got a lot of work to do to get unsuspended and not burned alive after this . So how about I grant you a wish and we go home ? '' Everyone else in the classroom was staring at me , frozen and unable to move , except for the Mr. Darson , who had simply disappeared and ran for the hills . When kids started to notice , they made their way to the door . The man snapped his fingers and the door slammed . `` Look , I 'm old , I ca n't tell you all apart . And who ever summoned me has to stay here and let me go , or else I am stuck here forever , and forever is quite a while . Who summoned me ? '' My brain seemed to have left as I raised my hand , `` So it was you . What do you want ? '' I hesitated for a moment , before realizing I was in control here . I smirked . `` I want no more math class , a million dollars , a lifetime supply of nutella and wifi wherever I go . '' `` I said I would grant one wish , you entitled brat . But I am busy so your wishes are granted . '' I smiled . `` Small conditions though , I gave everyone else a million dollars , so its worthless now , and your wifi will always be slow , and you can never lock in to a faster one . The nutella will make you sick , as you are allergic to it now , but you ca n't eat anything else . And as for math class , I 'll let that one slide . '' Then he smiled and was gone , leaving me to contemplate my fate . <newline> <newline> So maybe complicated was a bit of an understatement , I think 'very complicated ' fits my day just fine . <newline>"

He 's my best friend actually . When I was a young boy living in the shit hole that was London , my entire family was killed by the black plague . I remember sitting in our infested home , painful expressions etched into my family 's faces , black dots on their skin . I was too young to have anywhere else to go , and no one would come for me since our entire neighborhood had perished due to the disease , and so I sat alone and waited for death to find me as it had done for everyone else I had known . <newline> <newline> But instead of death knocking at my door , it was a tall , lean man with scares on his face and a smile most unpleasant . He strode into my home , knocking over glasses as he went , laughing in the faces of my family 's misfortune . It took him a few minutes to realize that I was there , and that I was breathing . <newline> <newline> `` Blast , '' he said , `` I thought I 'd gotten them all . '' <newline> <newline> He approached me swiftly , like a cat encircling his food . I hardly moved away from his horrible appearance . He reeked of death and dirt and I felt his presence like a weight on my chest . I know that this was the moment that I would die and I awaited its warm embrace to take me from my cold home . <newline> <newline> The man pushed his nose inches from my flushed cheeks . His auburn-red eyes looked me up and down , lingering on my sad eyes . He stood up and put his hand on his chin . <newline> <newline> `` Hum , '' he said . `` Perhaps ... '' <newline> <newline> Deep in thought , he walked away , walking the length of the shadowy room like a shark encircling its prey . Every so often he would glance my direction , and I allowed myself to fall closer and closer to the floor . I would never climb the big tree in our front yard , I would never get to kiss the beautiful girl who lived next door , and I would never know what it felt like to be an adult . I had experienced more pain , suffering , and fear in the last few months that nothing really surprised me anymore . With flushed cheeks I watched the man as the anger in his eyes melted into something else . I think now that it was dark determination , but at the time I fancied it might have been empathy or affection . <newline> <newline> `` Do you know who your father was ? '' The man said . His voice echoed around me , bouncing off my families memories and hitting me on all sides . <newline> <newline> `` Mr . Wallace . '' I said lightly . My voice was raspy as no water had touched my lips in days . `` He ... he was a wealthy Captain . A great man on the sea . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , '' the man said , `` Your father was not a man on the sea . He was a man of the sea . A man who controlled the sea . And now he 's dead . And you have no idea what you are . '' The man grinned . <newline> <newline> `` I may have some use for you yet . '' <newline> <newline> The rest of my childhood plays back to me in pictures of magnificent views and wealth . The man adopted me and I soon came to realize that he was the most horrid person I had ever had the misfortune to know . But he was also fantastically different and magical . He could pursue anyone to do anything he wanted . He could make people suffer for giving him news he did n't want to hear , he could reward those who did well by him with the snap of his fingers , and he never aged . We walked together through the centuries , spilling misfortune on those who crossed us , and I was taught to believe , to understand , that I was different too . And I was special . Not just a man but a God . <newline> <newline> I began to go by the name Devarajas meaning `` King of Gods , '' and I slowly began to forget my mortality as if it had been a dream . I could n't remember suffering , and nor did I want to . I was a King . I was a ruler of the Underworld , and I was capable of the most horrible of things . I brought plagues upon lands and scorched entire villages to the ground . I bathed in their screams , the most soothing of sounds , and I loved every minute of it . <newline> <newline> Satan began to refer to me as his son . The heir to his Kingdom . And I accepted without a second thought . For I was Devar . I was important . And anyone who disagreed would burn . <newline> <newline> I am not certain how many years went by , but I grew from a young flushed cheeked boy into a strong , wealthy , and handsome man .

Mom was sobbing this morning , kissing my face over and over as they pulled me away from her . Her voice broke when she told me I was a good kid and that she wanted me to be brave . I did n't feel brave . I looked up , glancing at the other guys in the crowded ship . Their faces were pale too , but maybe that was just the flickering light overhead . I thought about my brother then , and a sharp pang went through me at the thought of his laughing face . Charlie loved to laugh . He was always tossing me in the air or carrying me around on his back before he was dragged into this same hellhole that I 'm in now . The memory of his leaving was like a jagged wound , still raw . He was smiling as he left , assuring me that the newest technology would mean the war ended soon . <newline> <newline> <newline> His body was delivered to our doorstep a month later . <newline> The man in black who knocked on our door said , `` Consider yourselves lucky to be getting a body back at all . Usually we just have to send a flag and our condolences . Your brother had some good friends over there who retrieved his body for you . '' Did I mention that the flag-making industry is booming ? My brother used to smell like soap and sunshine but now I can only remember the smell of fresh dirt as we buried him under the maple tree in the backyard , next to Dad and my oldest brother Eric . <newline> <newline> The crashing of the waves sounded louder in the hull . I glanced up and fear squeezed my heart . The door was opening and boats were being lowered into the water . I looked over at the guys in my group , wondering how the boys I 'd been training with the past couple of months would handle this- our first glimpse of true combat . Anthony was sobbing , repeating his Hail Mary 's and Our Fathers as he clutched his crucifix . Michael was smiling , his eyes kind of crazed . But Michael was kind of crazed , you know ? I heard he lost six brothers and two cousins to this already . He had told everyone at training that he was ready to gut some Germans as he sharpened his knife and laughed quietly to himself . Henry was staring at me , and I was sure that his same terrified look was on my face . There was shouting all around us , and we operated how we had been trained to get our little boat into the water . Screams and shells and chaos erupted as we emerged from the massive ship and headed toward the beach . There were bullets flying everywhere , and the yells as man after man was hit . My group , amazingly , was silent as we struck out for the beach . A whizzing sound zoomed past my ear before I heard an awful crunching noise and a groan . I looked back to see Henry clutching at his neck , blood running down between his fingers . <newline> <newline> <newline> We kept on , no time for looking at each other or trying to save Henry . Our boat barely made it to the beach before we ran for cover . The Germans had a good position but we would have air support in minutes . <newline> <newline> `` Be brave Christopher , '' Mom had whispered to me as she hugged me one last time . She 'd smelled of cookies and warmth and home . I angrily swiped at the tears in my eyes , trying to see where the bullets were raining down from . I finally saw the faintest form of pink up on the overhang . I lifted my gun , cocked it , and shot at what I was sure was a human . The gun from that position stopped firing after I squeezed my finger . I collapsed behind a rock , trying to ignore Michael as he gleefully clapped me on the shoulder and screamed his joy in my ear . My heart pounded hard in my chest , so hard I was sure it was going to stop soon . I was fairly certain I 'd just taken a life . <newline> <newline> <newline> And so it goes . We exchanged fire with the Germans throughout the day . My grandfather died in this war , on this very battlefield . They always said D-Day was supposed to be a turning point in the war . Instead we had ended up battling over France for so long that I had lost my father and brothers to this same nightmare . They were running out of men for a while , so women were even operating as soldiers for a while in the '80s . Mom served for a couple of years , which is why I 'd woken up to hear screams throughout my childhood . Mom was always trying to hide the fact that she had sons . She did n't want us to go , but they always find out . You help out in the factories or farms until you 're 16 and then they take you away for training for a year and then you 're expected to die for your country . <newline> <newline> From what I hear , the Japenese are finally out of the fight .

I was typing away in my gray cubicle at the keybaord my fingers grew accustomed to for the most of the morning without taking a break longer than 5 minutes until that clock ticked 12 . Noon ... Noon meant pause , right ... <newline> I took my cup of still lukewarm coffee with me and decided to go out for a stroll . On the off days like this , when I had trouble getting sense of being awake , a walk in a park would solve it for me in minutes . So , exiting the small building our company was housed it , I headed to the nearby park I 've visited dozens upon dozens of times since I 've started working there , 6 years ago . <newline> The park was as nice as it would get in a year , it was summer . Less than a hundred steps inside , you could no longer hear the noise of the cars and sun was n't unbearable at all , even tho it was noon . The only thing you could hear was hum of trees and their leaves in the wind accompanied by a slightly chilling sensation . I let myself float on the currents of the air which made the nature move ... But then I noticed it was n't like it used to be ... It was close , but something sinisterly small was off . <newline> I looked around , looking calm as ever even tho my heart was beating a couple beats more a minute than usual , small rush of adrenaline hitting into my head as I noticed ... In the top of one tree , I saw a glare . It was lense , camera lense . It was too high to be hunters camera , but it was pointing down ... Not looking at a trail used by animals , but at the one used by humans . <newline> With my moment crushed by uneasieness , I turned back and slowly walked away , fighting with my mind not to run , proving to it that running off would be irrational . Slowly nearing the exit gate of the park , chirp of the birds was baiting my gaze up . I stopped as I was trying to see what bird it was , I did n't recognize the chirp in my untreated grogginess . Looking up , I noticed another , sinister glare . I looked down , rubbed my eyes , to make sure it was n't me , looked up again and the glare was still piercingly obvious . It was getting creepier by the moment . <newline> I just left , the park did it 's purpose , it made me wake up ... Sure , not how I expected it to achieve that goal , but goal was achieved . I had a lot of work to do that day . I returned to my cubicle in no time , only half an hour had passed . I decided to use half an hour of pause left to catch up a bit on the piled up work . <newline> I worked and worked and worked and I did n't notice the time until my co-worker tapped me on the shoulder . He was telling me it was end of the shift , 4pm already . I looked up at him with a smile , only about to say 'Thanks ' as another glare from above his shoulder stopped me ... Another camera ... Looking at my cubicle . <newline> I shook it off , once more , as just my paranoia , got my coat and headed for home . I was soon at my front door and I opened it without hesitation , only to drop my jaw when I saw another one . It was in the far right corner of the room . I never had camera security in my home . That white thing with black lense was pointed right at the entrance . <newline> I knew it was n't paranoia anymore , someone really was following my every step ... It reminded me too much of how hunters watch their prey and its habits before hunting it down ... Maybe I was dealing with a hunter after all ..."

TITLE PROVIDED : GUIDE TO THE MULTIVERSE ( INTRODUCTION ) . AUTHOR ID 0 ... 6 . <newline> <newline> Hello , and welcome to the known multiverse ! I 'm here to be your guide , and as such you can call me `` guide . '' If you need any help throughout the multiverse , you can pull out this electronic^tm device and say `` Hey guide ! '' I 'll be glad to assist you . <newline> <newline> You are recieving this guide for one of a few reasons : <newline> <newline> * You have turned 18 in DRAGON . <newline> * You have accidentally discovered the portal to DRAGON by stupidly jumping off the St. Louis Arch . <newline> * You found the portal to DRAGON on purpose by stupidly jumping off the St. Louis Arch <newline> * You have returned to DRAGON as a ghost because you are associated with a living soul in DRAGON and have come to exact revenge . <newline> <newline> I have different paths for each of these different options . Please choose an option ! <newline> <newline> **I have turned 18 in DRAGON . ** <newline> <newline> Congrats ! Welcome to adulthood in DRAGON , where the living live with the dead . You 've no doubt wondered why you 've , on repeated occasions , woken up to mysterious hovering baseball bats or the smell of burning things . Live in fear no longer ! There are ghosts on DRAGON , and anyone who dies within DRAGON or dies and has some beef with someone in DRAGON will return to DRAGON as a ghost . <newline> <newline> Now , you may be wondering , `` Why are you referring to earth as DRAGON ? '' Well , DRAGON is just one of many multiverses in what we know as the MEDIUM . The MEDIUM is all of the multiverses , and each multiverse is created when a decision is made . Sometimes it 's as simple as a yes/no decision - `` do I go to the movies ? '' Each time a decision is made , all the other possible decisions are also made at the same time ! DRAGON was formed with a decision which must have been rather large , as our universe exists with ghosts . <newline> <newline> If you are ever bothered by ghosts , you can call 666 - I repeat , 666 - and a friendly ghost will be dispatched to your location . These ghosts can not speak , but they can choose to be invisible or interact with the physical world . They are `` released , '' so to speak , when what they meant to do while alive is fufilled . Some ghosts are never released ! <newline> <newline> For further information on obtaining a drivers license in DRAGON , say `` I want to drive '' For further information on job opportunites , say `` I need a job . '' For information on permanent ghost prevention opportunities , for example , if you have a great-aunt who always meant to kill you during your lifetime but never did , say `` I 'm being haunted . '' For any other information , just ask ! <newline> <newline> > EOF"

    "target": "He 'd been practicing lucid dreaming . This idea of being able to control his dreams fascinated him and he would often wander around the world , flying to places he had never been . In fact , this question had pestered him all of his life : `` How can I see things and places I 'd never been to ? '' . <newline> <newline> Tonight was no different . He 'd brushed his teeth , gargled a strong mint flavored mouthwash and jumped straight into bed . As usual , he had set his alarm to 3am . Just enough time to fall into REM sleep and be awaken so he could bring his brain back down to the near meditative state of lucid dreaming . Just before letting his brain go , he repeated to himself in his mind : `` Tonight , I 'm gon na figure out the meaning of life . I 'm gon na see the source of us all and find out why are we here. '' . He was incredibly smart but not especially attractive and by any definition , an underachiever . This would let his brain free to fantasize about being the one who would one day be the most influential person in history . `` I mean , I have the brains , I 'm a genius ... it 's just that no one realizes it '' - he 'd often think to himself . <newline> <newline> *BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP* <newline> <newline> No matter for how long he 'd been doing this , he 'd get the heavy head feeling every time the alarm went off . But he always instinctively knew what he had to do . He flipped his pillow to the cool side and once more he was focusing on the meaning of life . Soon after he was in a void . He had waken up not floating above his body but in a darkness so blinding that he could not see his own hands in front of his face . In fact , he had already started to check all his dream indicators and they had all failed the test . The watch on his wrist was ticking , his could not breathe if he held his nose and his index finger did not go through his palm as it usually would . <newline> <newline> `` What the heck ? ! '' - he said out loud reaching to his bedside lamp switch as he assumed he had simply woken up . There was nothing , he was in complete void . Nothing was within reach . In fact , he had just now realized he was floating . There was no floor , no bed , just him . <newline> <newline> Suddenly everything around him was bright as day . Blindingly white everywhere . A white so bright he instinctively covered his eyes to soften the pain but it was of no use . His arm could not block the light . Then a figure emerged from the brightness , a human by any definition . He asked the figure : `` Where am I ? What is all of this ? '' . <newline> <newline> `` You do n't remember ? '' - the figure said , the features of whom could still not be discerned due to the light shining from behind it . <newline> <newline> `` Remember what exactly ? I was just laying on my bed , trying to fall asleep ... '' . <newline> <newline> The figure chuckled . `` I told you not to do it ... but you would n't listen . You have lucid dreamed 26 years in a dream where you got stuck . Lucid dreaming is how our species ' gathers intel on our prey on Earth . Recently Hokun challenged you to do a full cycle and lucid dream into the mind of a baby on Earth . You with your stubborn ways just would n't let it go and decided to go ahead ... '' - his face was now visible and he was clearly amused . <newline> <newline> `` So all of this ... you mean I 've actually been dreaming ? '' . <newline> <newline> `` Oh yes , and we 've been monitoring you all along . As it turns out , as soon as you were born , you fell in love with your mother so badly your sub conscious did n't want to leave anymore . But now here you are , you 're back , and we can use this brilliant new way to spy on those backwards monkeys . '' - the figure said , his eyes now squinting with visible hatred . <newline> <newline> It was all slowly starting to come back to him . He 'd implanted himself in a child 's mind as a way to go undetected to Earth 's LD-sensors . Every time , as soon as a child was born , his or her brain would be scanned and a baseline established for what were normal neural waves . Besides the normal changes through aging , the baseline did not significantly change throughout time . The Earth citizens would then all be implanted with a neural chip which upon detecting a major change in these waves , would change the physiology of their bodies to turn their skin blue ( thus being `` blue '' in Earth meant no one could trust you as you were being controlled by an LD'er ) . <newline> <newline> `` At any rate , you 've succeeded . '' - the figure continued - `` This was the final part of your training as a Vonture LD'er . You had to get into someone 's mind and have them commit suicide ... but you decided to take things a step further . '' <newline> <newline> `` Suicide ? Do"

Watch out ! He might call lighting from the sky !

The larger huntsman looked back over his shoulder with a raised eyebrow . <newline> <newline> Regaining composure , he continued , `` There is a lot of misinformation spread about how weaving works . I make it a point to correct this . '' A spark behind the man 's eyes showed he was eager to continue the discussion . `` Now , where shall we begin ?

'' I shouted from the living room , as I furiously cleaned up the shattered remains of a lovely vase that we had received as a wedding gift . “ Just finished ! ” chirped Wendy from the kitchen . We were about to throw a party celebrating our one year anniversary . God I love that woman . All of a sudden , a shock ran down my spine as a voice with notes of fire and brimstone whispered in my ear , “ ***WENDY WILL DIE IN CHILDBIRTH*** , ” followed by giggling , not unlike that of a small child . I rolled my eyes and sighed . A column of fire erupted from the stove , and my wife let out a high pitched shriek , followed by a string of curses and colorful insults . When we bought the house six months ago , we didn ’ t expect to have housemates . Especially not demon children . <newline> <newline> <newline> We found out about them the first night we slept in the house , when Wendy and I were rudely awakened by visions of our parents dying . A voice that seemed to crackle and burn with the sins of a thousand souls exclaimed , “ **HELLO MORTALS , WELCOME TO OUR PLAYHOUSE . ME AND MY FRIEND LIVE HERE . OUR NAMES ARE** , ” followed by something that I can only describe as the very embodiment of suffering . “ **BUT YOU MAY CALL US ABBY AND TOBY , AS MERE MORTALS CAN NOT SAY OUR NAMES , ** ” the voice continued . Wendy and I looked at each other , with pure shock on our faces . I managed to collect myself , and stammered , “ W-what are you ? ” The voices giggled excitedly , and I swear I heard a bit of a snicker as well . “ **WE ARE DEMONS OF HELL . I AM ABBY , THE DAUGHTER OF ABBADON , AND TOBY IS THE SON OF CAIM . WE LIVE HERE , UNTIL WE ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BECOME COMMANDERS OF HELL . ** ” Demons , huh , I thought to myself . Isn ’ t it odd that they mentioned that they needed to be “ old enough ” ? How old are demons anyway , I pondered . “ How old are you two ? ” I asked , still terrified , but now curious . “ **WE ARE BOTH FIVE HUMAN YEARS OLD . ** ” I was caught off guard- I never thought that demons… had children . “ How old do you need to be to be commanders of Hell ? ” “ **TWO HUNDRED HUMAN YEARS OLD . ** ” I looked at Wendy . Her expression was as bewildered as mine . <newline> <newline> <newline> As the months went on , we got used to their antics- we kept a collection of vases in the car , and bought several fire extinguishers for the numerous fires that broke out due to demon children not knowing how to control their powers . They were actually kind of cute- every time they scared us , they would always laugh , just like regular kids . Abby liked to tell stories through the flames she created in our living room . Toby enjoyed practicing his musical talents by rhythmically breaking our vases . Wendy made a spinoff version of Candyland , simply called “ Hell ” , and Abby and Toby would occasionally even join in . On July 4th , we had the best bonfire and fireworks show in the neighborhood . In all honesty , it was pretty fun most of the time . <newline> <newline> Today though , I was not having it . “ Abby ! Toby ! Stop it right NOW ! ” I shouted , my voice booming through the whole house . Suddenly , the house stood still . I let out a deep breath , and continued in a much quieter voice , “ We are having guests tonight , and it ’ s very important . Just a few hours , please . Then y ’ all can go back to your antics. ” Two voices replied in perfect , depressing harmony , “ **FINE . WE WILL BE QUIET . ** ” “ Thank you , ” I exclaimed with a smile . I finished sweeping up the vase , and threw away broken shards . I went into my garage , grabbed another vase from the car , and placed it where the now broken one had stood . <newline> <newline> The door bell rang . “ Now remember , be quiet ! ” I said , as I went to open the door . <newline> <newline> -- -- <newline> <newline> This is the first short story I 've written in a long time , and my first writingprompt submission !

Today , however ... <newline> <newline> `` I apologize for the security measures , my dear . I do hope you were n't hurt . '' <newline> <newline> I brushed some ash off my shoulder and tried not to worry about the state of my hair . The fireballs seemed a bit overkill , but I could understand the need for some amount of protection . `` Not at all Mr. Savage . I 've had some practice navigating mine fields and laser grids . '' <newline> <newline> Mr. Horace Savage , better known as the Maneater in the tabloids more prone to illustration , gestured for one of his servants to bring me a glass of water . For an office located in an old stone castle situated on the edge of a cliff on an island in the Caribbean , the place had a classy , formal feel to it . Seems that crime pays occasionally , and pays quite well . `` How can I help you , Ms . ... ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Harkness . Jenny Harkness . I work for the Heroes Holding Hands foundation , which arranges for terminally ill children to meet their idols , particularly vigilantes and superheroes . '' I pulled a manilla folder out of my briefcase and I passed it to him across the desk . He flipped it open with a gnarled and calloused hand , revealing a glossy 8 '' x10 '' photo of a 13-year-old boy . `` This is Richard -- '' <newline> <newline> `` Let me stop you there , '' he said , putting up a hand . `` I do n't know if you 've noticed the thunder striking the watchtower or the vicious attack hounds patrolling the gates , but I am not a hero by any stretch of the imagination . Much less a *super*hero . Maybe an anti-hero -- '' <newline> <newline> *Definitely* not an anti-hero , '' I said , cutting him off . `` According to our standard scale , you are certified as 96 % Villain . In order for the government to classify us as a non-profit organization , our name implies that we only communicate with sanctioned superheroes . However , the term 'hero ' or 'idol ' is completely subjective , decided ultimately by the children themselves . '' I pushed the photograph closer . `` Richard Morton has a congenital heart defect that , even with a heart transplant , will likely kill him within five years . He specifically requested the opportunity to meet the villain known as Maneater . '' <newline> <newline> He picked up the photo and studied it more carefully . `` And you actually took this brat seriously ?

'' <newline> <newline> `` The visit is strictly conversational . '' <newline> <newline> `` I see . '' His dark eyes narrowed on me . `` What do I get out of this ? '' <newline> <newline> My favorite question . For most heroes , they simply enjoy doing a good deed every now and again . Others ' have egos that need to feed off of good publicity . Mr. Savage had completely different wants than anyone I 've ever dealt with . But I get paid the big bucks because I can identify them and make these people do anything I want . No , I do n't have superpowers . I simply observe . <newline> <newline> `` HHH offers no compensation . We do n't make any travel plans for our clients or the talent as that makes it easier for assassins to target the superheroes . Or , as I imagine would be the case for you , Sonic Screech or the police would track you down almost immediately . Meaning we count on your word that you will appear and speak to the child on your dime with your own security . '' <newline> <newline> He raised an eyebrow at me . `` You might want to work on your negotiation tactics , Ms . Harkness . '' <newline> <newline> Placing my hands , fingers laced together , on the desk , I leaned forward . `` May I be blunt ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Bash away .

    "target": "A living Barbie doll , complete with a bleached-blonde bun hairdo , bubble-gum pink lips , and matching nails , stormed into the green room . She wore a light grey suit with a skirt that was just a bit too short for a businesswoman , but certainly gave her an excuse to show off those legs . Not wearing tights was bold , but her legs only had one or two scars . Her eyes surveyed the room through a harsh squint , examining every aspect of the décor and furnishings . She even ran one finger over the top of the mirror to make sure there was no dust . Finally her eyes settled on me with that same look , and for a moment I thought she was going to check me for dust too . “ You must be the new makeup girl , ” she surmised . <newline> <newline> “ Yes , Ma ’ am. ” I ’ d been doing makeup for celebrities , politicians , and glamorous wealthy women for a decade , but somehow her tone still made me feel like a just-out-of-beauty-school fuckup who could barely dye hair correctly . <newline> <newline> “ I see. ” She looked me up and down , noting with just a hint of surprise that I wore a sleeveless shirt . By my age , most people go to great lengths to cover up their lying scars ; I was fortunate enough to have relatively unblemished skin . I had the average number of little fibs and white lies , of course , but nothing deep . “ Well , you ’ ll do , I guess. ” She took a seat on the nearby couch while I remained standing . “ Now . The first thing you need to know is that he is *very* sensitive about his skin , all right ? So the very first rule is *do not comment on it . * That is the quickest way to get fired , and we 'll have your ass in court so fast it 'll make your head spin. ” <newline> <newline> I nodded . Most people were self-conscious about scars , and I ’ d learned that pretty quickly . I ’ d made it my *hallmark* to cover up even the worst of the worst . I guess that was why I ’ d been hired . And discretion was always the name of the game with big-name talent . <newline> <newline> Her phone buzzed , and she dug through her purse to find it . “ He ’ s on his way into the building , ” she informed me . “ Get ready. ” There wasn ’ t much to do ; it ’ s not like I needed to have my makeup brush in hand the moment the door opened or something . So I just stood there awkwardly . <newline> <newline> The door banged open a few moments later , and a tuxedoed security guard entered . He swept the room from behind dark glasses , then nodded to the blonde woman . “ All clear , ” he spoke into his sleeve cuff . <newline> <newline> Two more security guards came over the threshold , and then my client entered the room . I ’ d seen him on TV a hundred times , but never without makeup . And as he took off his shirt so that the makeup on his wrists and neck would match , I could instantly see why . It took all of my willpower to remain rooted to my spot instead of running to the bathroom and vomiting . It wasn ’ t that he had a ton of scars all over like most people . It was that his body was pretty much *one giant scar* . I tried not to stare , but I desperately wanted to just to see if there was *any* real skin left amidst all the scar tissue . I couldn ’ t even *imagine* the whopper he must have told to get that . <newline> <newline> “ This is your new makeup girl , ” the blonde woman said from the couch . “ It ’ s… ummm… ” <newline> <newline> “ Anne , ” I informed him , looking him straight in the eyes so that my gaze wouldn ’ t drift south . He just nodded at me , then went back to typing something on his phone . <newline> <newline> “ Well ? ” the blonde woman hissed at me . “ Get to it ! ” <newline> <newline> *Right* . I was so focused on not staring that I had forgotten all about doing his makeup . I jumped to life and opened up my kit like a doctor choosing his tools for surgery . I ’ d *never* had to do something like this . Normal skin tone cover-up was pretty much out of the picture here , because scars at *that* level would still be visible . So instead I grabbed the darkest shade I ’ d brought and began to apply it to his cheeks . <newline> <newline> It took me at least half an hour , but I managed to perfectly conceal every single part of the scar by pretty much painting over his entire skin . The whole time I wondered why they needed me when they could have gotten one of those good special effects artists from out in Hollywood . But finally I put on the last touches , held up the mirror , and waited for some sign of approval . <newline> <newline> He looked up from his phone , which he ’ d been on through the whole session . His lips , naturally thin but made even thinner by the amount of makeup on the surrounding parts of his face , pursed into a thin smile . “"

    "target": "A chime sounds as the front door swings open , and the chatter dies down upon her entrance . Edison , with his back to the door and eyes drowning in his drink , is pretty sure it 's a good looking girl , at least . No , not just good looking . Stunning . And famous . Had to be . A lot of gorgeous aspiring actresses in this city . It takes a special girl , a noted girl , to make a room full of men go quiet . Edison then considers the possibility that his speculation about the behavior of his fellow man might be pure horseshit because , in all likelihood , he is just projecting himself onto everyone else . Because he 's the one who goes quiet and studies the floor whenever a pretty girl enters within a twenty yard radius from himself . <newline> <newline> The jukebox is still going strong , though , blaring some godawful dubstep track that sounds roughly like a giant robot experiencing a colossal case of the reverberating shits . Then a click , and the music halts . Then the girl ( surely it must be a girl , those delicate clicks on the floor must be those of stalking high heels , not the wide heavy soles of man shoes ) makes her way from the jukebox to the bar counter . <newline> <newline> Edison does not turn to look , because he pretty much just withers and dies whenever a pretty gal looks him once over and , inevitably , dismisses him without another thought . He is still a man , though , if a pathetic one , and he makes like he 's adjusting his glasses so that he can peer into the pint glass before him , when really he 's just checking out her silhouette in the reflection against a backdrop of bubbling amber . He is well practiced at this surreptitious art and , from what he can tell , she really does have a knockout body , all the more enhanced by her slinky walk . <newline> <newline> Amazingly enough , she is heading right for him . <newline> <newline> He is convinced that she means to walk past him , not to him . Even when her high heels stop dead behind him , his eyes remain glued to the glass , taking in her lines and curves to the last . <newline> <newline> Then a smart voice , with a hint of sultry , says , “ Geez , the last man standing is you ? ” <newline> <newline> He 's not quite sure what she means by that , but he wants to turn around , smile , and tell her that , technically , he is the last man sitting . But he is Edison Periwinkle , and Edison Periwinkle does n't say that sort of thing around women . Edison Periwinkle says things like : <newline> <newline> “ Huh ? Excuse me ? ” <newline> <newline> A light giggle . “ Not much of a talker , are you ? Well , that 's fine , I 'm not really in the mood for talk anyway. ” <newline> <newline> He has no idea what she 's going on about , and he lapses back into silence , a doughy mound in expensive ill-fitting clothes , huddled over his glass . His palms are sweaty , as Edison notices that her reflected hair looks vaguely like Mom 's spaghetti . Then he nearly jumps out of his shoes as the trace of a fingernail runs a track along the blades of his back . <newline> <newline> “ You ever wear a blindfold , mister ? ” <newline> <newline> Under her spell , he shakes his head , hair standing on end . <newline> <newline> “ Oh , a first timer then . Well then , may I ? ” <newline> <newline> Goosebumps and double meanings abound . Surely a knowing smile on her part , as he hears the rush of silken cloth free itself inside a pair of hands . He then realizes she has asked a question , and he answers with a stilted nod . <newline> <newline> His world goes soft and black , and then he goes spinning as inhuman strength hauls him off the stool and onto the bar counter , accompanied by a terrific crash of shattering glasses . Then her smooth warmth slides onto him , straddling him . She is by no means a heavy girl , but she feels heavy to him nonetheless because he 's never had a girl on top of him before . <newline> <newline> This has to be a joke . A practical joke of the highest degree . Candid camera of sorts . Most elaborate setup ever . No other explanation . <newline> <newline> As she undoes his belt buckle , he whispers , “ Who are you ? Why are you doing this ? ? What 's going on ? ? ” <newline> <newline> She answers by yanking his belt free and tossing it aside . <newline> <newline> “ What about everyone else here , for christ 's sake ! ” <newline> <newline> A pleasant laugh which chills him to the bone , telling him this is all for real . “ Do n't worry , baby , all they can do is watch . ”"

Near the bottom of the chain , where the locket hung , some of the gold plating had worn off revealing the cheap metal beneath .

She started to climb the stairs . <newline> <newline> The exterior of the locket was inscribed with a Golden Snitch from the Harry Potter series . The wings of the snitch were outstretched like a bird in flight . Originally tiny inscribed lines had given fine details to the feathers of the wings , but over time the details had been lost .

It was a Golden Snitch which meant so much more to them . <newline> <newline> “ When I asked if you would go out with me , and you said , yes , ” he had said , “ I felt like Harry Potter catching the Snitch and winning the Quidditch Cup .

Her eyes were swimming in bliss , and he was looking back at her confidently smiling . In that picture the rest of the world fell away , and a future of love stretched out before them . Together they would walk hand in hand towards that future . <newline> <newline> Now , there was another woman with her hands over him . <newline> <newline> The hinge snapped as she tore the locket in two . The side with his face came off in her hand leaving the cheap metal exposed on the half that still hung from the tarnished chain . She took the locket and threw it at his naked body , but it hit the other woman ’ s exposed breast . She grabbed the other half of the locket and pulled down hard . In one quick move the clasp at the back of her neck snapped , and the locket came away in her hand . She threw the locket to the ground , and the thin glass over her frozen , smiling face shattered breaking apart that moment of love and admiration . <newline> <newline> The locket stayed there on that bare cold floor , a broken memento lingering in promises torn apart and a love ended ."

    "target": "The human word to describe the first moments of life , is birth . That word , despite all of the human emotion and instinctual pride associated with it , has little meaning to me . The wonder of coming into a new world , and being slowly integrated into it as synapses begin to multiply , and memory becomes tangent , is lost on me . <newline> <newline> Wonder comes from a lack of complete understanding . When a child sees a common phenomenon , but misunderstands it , it becomes a wonder . Things that were once incapable of explanation and are full of mystery and awe , are subjected to a gauntlet of apathy and dissociation by the subjects viewing it . While some still find space to be a fascinating beast full of intrigue and unexplained queries , it has become a victim of apathy among other humans ; a black-hole that draws in money and produces no results . <newline> <newline> My first memories of life are plain to me , and that plainness removes all wonder . Nonetheless , discovering new things has taken me far . Dr. Simon Lynch , a pariah among his fellow engineers , spent his late teens and early twenties studying robotics and developing AI to perform more and more difficult tasks at MIT . His first major breakthrough was developing a program that could , in effect , change itself to better complete a task . <newline> <newline> It started as an idea , an algorithm that could take starting parameters , and simulate evolution . The first iterations involved a box car . A virtual track was created , and a car of any particular size could be made . Then , axels with wheels could be added up to any desired number . These wheels could be any variable size , and the pseudo-suspension could be facing in any direction juxtaposed to the vehicle frame . Once the car was designed , parameters could be set to control what each new iteration ( or new generation of car ) would have different from the previous generation , or parent . Probablility of change , as well as the total number of changes could be controlled . If a new generation performed better than the parent , this new vehicle would become the seed for the next cycle . <newline> <newline> This idea sparked Dr. Lynch to designed a program that would figure out how to stand , by changing the position of its feet , and use varying pressures from each of the four feet in order to stand fully erect . After many hours , and starting the program as far as possible from the successful parameters , the program succeeded at standing . This required the program to rewrite its own functions , and take measurements while performing , then analyze , and change based on results from each test . That machine , Project N.03 , could be called my great-great Grandfather , despite its lack of self-awareness . <newline> <newline> After writing programs to incorporate how to walk , reach , grab , lift and carry objects , build basic structures , and drive , Dr. Lynch decided to begin the impossible : getting a machine to recognize that it is an individual . <newline> <newline> Every aspect of life requires parameters , parameters that are natively programmed into human brains . Mapping this digitally is an incredibly difficult task . So , instead of trying to develop those himself , Dr. Lynch partnered with a Bio-Engineering Research and Development group in secret . They attached leads to his brain , monitor function , and spent years tracking menial tasks in order to catalogue how Dr. Lynch 's brain read in information , processed it , and developed a solution . <newline> <newline> Approximately 7 years before Dr. Lynch 's death at seventy-four , the biggest break came to the team . As Dr. Lynch 's mind slowed down , it became easier to determine and decipher how his mind was reading information and using it . After that discovery , Lynch utilized his two grandchildren , Mia and Caleb ( ages 5 and 9 respectively ) as the catalyst for evolving his program . By taking their brain patterns and using the algorithms for tracking and mapping brain function that the R & D group had developed , Lynch finally created a working , digital copy of a brain aged roughly at 9 years old . Being unable to copy chemical reactions and emotion , the stability of that brain , my brain , was always in turmoil , as it was still unable to grow and change . It was still a copy , devoid of true individuality . <newline> <newline> I knew language then , but could not speak . There were no vocal chords for my brain to manipulate . I understood fear , but could not feel it . I could not see either , as my eyes were far behind . But I could hear . There was a microphone on Lynch 's desk , and it would carry the analog signal and my brain would translate it into the machine language that my brain processes . <newline> <newline> He would talk to me constantly , telling me about his fear of mortality , his love for his children and grand-children . He told me about his life : accomplishments and failures . His wife , Annabeth Lynch , gave birth to a son , Thomas , in the winter of their fourth year of marriage . She then gave birth to a daughter , Valerie , one-and-a-half years later . <newline> <newline> I was born , officially , five years and seven months later , his third child . Although , the rest of the family did n't take kindly to my existence ."

Talk about wrong place wrong time , and triply bad luck to be carrying a pocket knife , which was the same kind of weapon I had used . <newline> <newline> I had thought about it long and hard during the proceedings , and I couldn ’ t let this man suffer for his crimes . I had done the deed . <newline> <newline> “ It ’ s eleven to one Ryan. ” A skinny male juror to my left told me . “ You ’ re just stalling at this point . All the evidence points to him . Why are you resisting ? ” Everyone was looking to me for an explanation . I ’ m sure I was sweating bullets . <newline> <newline> “ Because it ’ s all circumstantial. ” I told them . Circumstantial , that was a good word . I had heard it on lots of crime dramas . “ He was clearly in the neighborhood to buy some skittles , and was carrying a pocket knife on him from his boy scout days . I mean , he ’ s a boy scout , and he works in the legal system . He ’ s got that going for him right ? ” Most of the jurors didn ’ t buy this , but one man who had started on my side appeared to be listening . <newline> <newline> “ And the blood on the knife ? ” An older female juror asked as she looked at her watch . <newline> <newline> “ He cut himself picking the dirt out from under his fingernails. ” I responded . <newline> <newline> “ You don ’ t think it ’ s suspicious at all that he had bleached the blood on the knife ? ” The skinny one asked me again , looking almost bored . We had been over this a half dozen times . <newline> <newline> “ I mean , you ’ ve got ta keep your knife clean right ? What if somebody else wanted to use it or something ? ” <newline> <newline> “ That ’ s enough. ” A large man who claimed to play professional sports cut in . “ What ’ s going on Ryan ? We ’ ve been at this for hours . There ’ s something else going on . Tell us what it is. ” I sighed . There was no getting around it . <newline> <newline> “ I did it. ” I tell them . They exchange glances and wait for me to say more . “ I killed him , the pocket knife was mine. ” I ’ m expecting them to recoil , and a few of them lean away from me in their chairs . <newline> <newline> “ Even if we believed you. ” The large man said . “ There ’ s no way to convict you instead , unless you provided the evidence for your conviction yourself. ” What , my own confession couldn ’ t set this man free ? How was that possible . <newline> <newline> The big man sighed . “ Never the less , if this means you ’ re dead set on fighting a conviction we ’ d better tell the judge we have a hung jury. ” I breathed a sigh of relief . A lot of paperwork later we were outside the courthouse . The man would go free , and so would I everybody won . <newline> <newline> “ How do you explain the blood on the knife. ” The big man said from behind me . <newline> <newline> “ What ? ” I say to him , not believed that we ’ re still discussing this . <newline> <newline> “ Don ’ t you think it ’ s a little strange he bleached the knife and then didn ’ t clean it off ? It ’ s a little weird to be walking around with a knife with bleach on it isn ’ t it ? ” I looked confused at him , and he just looked disgusted and walked off . The man just couldn ’ t let it go . <newline> <newline> At that moment the defendant walked out . He caught my eye and walked over . “ He was still breathing when you left by the way. ” He tells me . “ I saw you leave and knew my next victim would be an easy one . All I had to do was hang around the crime scene , after I had finished him off , carry a suspiciously bloody knife . I had to bleach it to leave some doubt , but a little blood would get me arrested for sure . Then all I had to do was call someone at work before the cops showed up to make sure you ’ d be on the next homicide jury . ”"

    "target": "So this is where it had all led him . The sun rose beautifully over the cityscape , painting the clouds with its rays in pastel hues , colors changing as particles of light refracted and reflected , bouncing around the skies aimless and endless , purposeless , never to rest , and most of all unknowing of their own vain labors . <newline> <newline> Ray stepped over the guardrail and perched on the precipice of his 100-story lookout , pensive . Many things ran through his mind ; his shitty job , his hateful parents , the loss of his wife , the only person he 'd ever truly loved . But mostly he wondered how his reaper could have abandoned him so . <newline> <newline> To most people , a reaper was a curse : a constant reminder that death was always there , waiting . An undeniable proof that no one lives forever , and everyone will die sooner than they think . The closer it was , the sooner you would die . <newline> <newline> Despite society 's countless incredible technological achievements , they could never figure out how to separate themselves from death personified . This never stopped the rich and powerful from trying ; as their reapers got closer , no insane pitch from a fast-talking entrepreneur was too outlandish for the wealthy to throw their money at . They called them Death Profits : a play on words of both the money made from misfortune and the undeniable truth that their failures proved . The diamond guillotine , the snake oil supplements , the guided meditation and isolation , even the hyper-boosted trips to space ; nothing could rid a person of their reaper . <newline> <newline> Which is why Ray loved his . Where most saw a terrifying ghoul , Ray saw a comforting promise . A guarantee that he would not have to exist forever . When his wife was killed in the car crash , Ray had seen in the rearview his own eyes , his own fear reflected as his wife 's reaper came barreling in from behind . In just a moment he realized it all ; they were due a freak accident , a change of fate . And then , grotesquely , a smaller reaper , its ghostly feet beating a silent *pitter-patter* , arm outstretched as it struggled to keep up with its mother . <newline> <newline> His daughter in the back . She was being cooed at by her laughing mother , gurgling happily in her carseat , blissful in her unknowing . What could Ray do ? *WHAT COULD HE DO ? * A thousand thoughts crossed his mind . *Prevent it somehow . Change fate . Swerve off the road . Offer your life as collateral . Pray for their earthly salvation . Something , something ! * <newline> <newline> She looked to him , one last time . In that final moment . Her eyes met his , laughing creases changing to worry in slow motion as she saw the unbridled terror in his eyes , he could see everything , he knew as her mouth begin to move in formation of the question **he knew** , it was too late , too late , and he would never forget . He could see it now in his mind in perfect detail , wind streaming in the half-open window , playing lazily with that lock of hair that she could never keep tied back . Her lovely chest beneath her white sweater expanding ever so slightly , unfettered by the seatbelt she hated so much to wear . The hazel-flecked green of her questioning eyes in the light , the pupils contracting in turn as the sun flowed over one before the other . Her soft lips just beginning to form his name , asking him to protect her , save them , keep her safe : his wife , the mother of his child , his only love and the only thing he ever loved , *save us Ray , save our baby* and yet he failed her , just as with everything else , he failed her too and her would never forgive himself . <newline> <newline> *Remember , Ray . Memorize it . Remember what you did . Never forget . * <newline> <newline> Just before the impact he could not find his reaper . He knew what was coming and he did not want to live , without them there would be nothing to live for and he knew he could not save them and he wanted to die . But his reaper was not there . It was not there and then the impact came , his world ending in a great explosive conglomeration of crashing glass and screeching metal and shrieking twisting screaming tearing and then blood , theirs and his mixed up slick and smelling of iron and heat in the smoldering car . <newline> <newline> She had gone through the windshield . There was a gash above his head pouring blood but remarkably his limbs were intact and he crawled out of the overturned car to find her , cutting his hands and knees on the crystal shards that lay in a carpet around the vehicle . His ears were ringing . As he failed to stand , he realized he could hear the baby crying weakly . He tried the door but it would n't budge . He surrendered his broken hands and pulled with all his might , the glass cutting into his fingers and bleeding down and around the handle . Nothing . He was raising his elbow to smash it into the glass , and then felt a ghastly chill . <newline> <newline> It was passing through him . Her reaper . Bony arms outstretched , wisps of ethereal smoke trailing behind as it moved to fulfill its grotesque"

But the important thing for you to remember , is that no matter what you do in this life . There is always someone better , faster and stronger . And sometimes life will ask you challenge yourself . Ask you to take your world into your own hands . And regardless of the how important your next meal , they 're just that . Another meal .

It was a good substitute for handcuffs- easy to carry , cheap and cutting into the victim 's neck or wrists with just a little bit of movement . <newline> <newline> It was a pity , but people did n't seem to realize it was easy enough to slip out of if you put your wrist in a specific position as you were being tied up . <newline> <newline> Tyler smiled broadly to himself beneath the black bag tied around his head . He could feel the car rumbling beneath him as it swerved this way and that . <newline> <newline> At last , they stopped somewhere . He was dragged out into a light rain and further into some sheltered area- a warehouse by the docks , he guessed , from the smell of saltwater in the air and the patter of rain on zinc roofing . <newline> <newline> Someone sat him on a chair and pulled off the bag . <newline> <newline> `` Good evening . '' <newline> <newline> He blinked for a moment . Let 's see ... swinging light bulb , check . Thugs with guns , check .

Murder too . <newline> <newline> `` ... all you need is a white cat ... '' he murmured to himself . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't look so confused .

Not hurt . '' he said clearly , smiling , `` What kind of wuss are you starting out with a minor threat like that ? '' <newline> <newline> He 'd slipped out of the zipties a few moments ago . He lunged forward in a single fluid motion , snapping into a roll as he grabbed the shadowed man by the neck and used him as an impromptu meat shield . <newline> <newline> A few rounds found their targets in his shield but he was already ducking behind a large wooden crate in the shadows . His captive whimpered under his arm . <newline> <newline> `` Hush now ... if you stay put , I wo n't kill you dead . '' <newline> <newline> He leapt aside , sneaking behind one of the thugs nearing his crate and grabbing the man by the neck . There was a crack and he moved away , dancing around the chair he 'd been sat on moments before . He picked it up and slammed it into another thug , snapping off the chair leg and stabbing it into the man 's vulnerable throat . <newline> <newline> He grinned as he rose , tossing the bloodied chair leg away . The last thug was running out of the building . Casually , he picked up a gun from a fallen thug and aimed . <newline> <newline> `` And then there were none . '' <newline> <newline> The last thug fell with the bang , slumping outside . The rain did not quite disguise the gradually darkening puddle around his form . <newline> <newline> He walked behind the wooden crate only to find the man he 'd left there trying to crawl away . He stepped on the man 's back . <newline> <newline> `` You 're an amateur are n't you ? '' he mused . He lifted the injured man by the collar , dragging him back to the centre of the warehouse . <newline> <newline> Without hesitation , he emptied a bullet into the man 's shoulder . There was a scream and a splash of red . He stepped on the shoulder , grinding his heel down slightly to the sound of whimpers . <newline> <newline> He leaned down , smiling beatifically as he pulled the man up by his tie . <newline> <newline> `` Now , this is how you do a proper interrogation ...

Nobody was going to show up and tell him to stop . Nobody was left to be the boss of him . <newline> <newline> But it would n't be fair to waste time on distractions , not now , not to her . The breath which came from her was heavy , now , and laboured , an unhealthy and guttural noise . Beads of sweat had drenched her pretty face , chiseled away the make-up and coagulated it into small mounds - she had the complexion of a mountain range , with lakes of perspiration in the valleys and clefts . <newline> <newline> She could n't go on without him - not in any direction , least of all up . The water was still rising , or at least it was the last time he checked . If he let her stay here , she 'd be drowned . <newline> <newline> And she was his love . More than that , his only hope , humanity 's only hope . The last woman , surely a good mother given the chance . If he left her here to die , she 'd never be given the chance . <newline> <newline> So he had to continue , carry her by hook or crook to the mountain 's peak , the pinnacle atop the world , where safety from the flood would be found , if it was anywhere to be found . In a strange sort of way , he was now as dependent on her as she was on him : without her , his dreams would die .

The only thoughts he could allow were those which strengthened his resolve , thoughts of a future where Jess was as alive as he was . <newline> <newline> Thoughts of a hundred thousand lost futures . The names , the faces , swirling in his mind : Eva , Jon , Caro , Chris . Gone now , but they lived in him . <newline> <newline> Was it really worth it , though , in the end , when everything was tallied together and the final scores were in ? The wounds Jess had suffered were deep , her pale dress red with still-pouring blood . She might die at the top of the hill , and even if she did n't , bearing children could be impossible for her now . Sure , they could enjoy a lifetime together alone , but all the hard work that needed would make their time scarce , and who would be there when they were old , to feed them and soothe their pain ? Perhaps it would be a kindness to return to the water , hold Jess ' face beneath the surface and quell the uncertainty . <newline> <newline> She slipped from his grasp , stumbled to the ground . He pulled her back to her feet , but with an effort he could n't sustain . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't give up , Jess . '' He spoke to her , but he was n't speaking to her . He was speaking to his own desires , his own wishes . Yet still she spoke to him . <newline> <newline> `` I wo n't . '' A staccato whisper , each word broken by the gargling and hissing of her deathbound voice . `` As long as you do n't . '' <newline> <newline> And he would n't give up , not ever . Jess went through hell for him , and he for her . He 'd do it again in a heartbeat . For Jess , or for the memory of Jess ."

Two minutes passed before he saw the speck in his wing mirror . He slowed to 60mph and rolled up his window , just as the sound of the other trucks engine started creeping into the cabin . <newline> <newline> The following truck approached quickly , and within a minute it was only a copule of car lengths behind Lou 's trailer . There was a knock from the panel behind his head , and he flashed his hazard lights . The other truck slowly pulled up beside , and Lou steered the huge vehicle closer to the dividing line . As the two drivers became parallel , they gave each other a small nod , then continued to keep an eye on the road . All the drivers wore caps and sunglasses - most had beards or moustaches , to ensure they could n't be identified . Lou did n't even know who and what was in the back of the truck . <newline> <newline> Earlier in the day , Lou had driven to a truck stop , where a marked trailer was waiting for him . A bag of money was hidden underneath , which was the first part of his payment . The bag also contained his `` deliver instructions '' which usually contained a time and place for the transaction . This ensured anonymity for the driver and the two parties carrying out the trade . As normal , after the deal was completed , Lou would stop at another designated location , where another hidden bag of money would be waiting for him , and unhitch the trailer . The work was easy , and it paid very well . <newline> <newline> <newline> Today was not a normal day however . Lou heard raised voices behind him , and suddenly became more alert . He heard muffled shouting , and then a loud bang blasted through the cabin . Screaming and gunshots followed , and before Lou could react , the other driver raised a shotgun to his window and fired . <newline> <newline> Instinctively , Lou flinched and hunkered down in his chair , slamming his foot on the accelerator . He threw his head up to steer the vehicle back into the middle of the road , ignoring the shotgun pellets which had embedded themselves in his bulletproof window . Lou looked out the wing mirror and saw the other truck roll off the road and coast to a halt .

I was tripping mad balls because it was just cause i have white walls and a white image flashed on the screen at the same time . Anyways i was hungry so i grabbed a bag of m & m 's off the coffee table and started gobling them up , they were super tasty and before i knew it i just had 1 blue m & m left . It was like torture how had i ate them all already😩 this last eminem was all the sweets i had in the whole house . Wtf ? Another mouse ? Wtf no dont click my m & m ! I watched in horror as seemingly in slow motion the mouse slowly slid down to delete **Poof** i stared at the palm of my hand were my last piece of chocolate used to be in dismay.. that was real.. i saw it that time it wasnt the drugs . My eminem is GONE i have no more sweets anywhere 😭my mouth is so salty i needed that m & m i was freaking out cause somthing actually just deleted my candy . I looked up and my tv wasnt even there anymore like i first thought it actually was gone ! After it disappeared i must have just imagined a comercial playing in the space were my tv used to be because of the drugs , that was so crazy i only saw it there for a second cause i looked away but i swear for like 3 seconds in the space on my wall were my tv was i saw a farm and fleet commecial playing , it was soo vivid . I stared again in dismay at my wall this time stunned that my HD tv was actually missing . I was scared . What was happening ? Am i inside a computer i thought ? I was afraid at any moment my arms or legs would start to dissappear or that the ground and my couch and house and everything would disappeare and i would fall into a dark black abyss of emptiness forever . As i sat on my couch trying to keep myself together while the acid actually started to kick in i heard a feminine computer voice , `` WINDOWS 10 UPDATE INSTALLING '' suddenly a big blue box flew infront of my with the widows logo and a progress bar on it . It read `` updates installing , will power off and install when completed '' . I looked around my living room but the big blue box stayed right in the center of my vision everytime i turned my head i was so frustrating . I could see only out my periferal vision and it was all blurry , but i started seeing everything around my living room start to dissappear as the progress bar proceeded to to 100 % mark . It was currently at 52 and picking up speed . I watched as all my prized possessions around my house dissapeared until suddenly i couldnt see anything . Wait a minute , i looked up and my house was rising above me suoer fast and it was surrounded by pitch black , i looked all around me in all directions and it was pitch black . I had to look up sort of diagonally to see my house to see it through my peripheral vision , and it was rapidly shrinking . I realized I was falling , falling into a deep dark abyss of nothingness just as i had feared . I looked down at my arms and I noticed my fingertips dissappearing , the progressbar read `` 97 % '' . I was completely horrified as i slowly watched my arms and legs dissappear , my worst fear was happening and i couldnt do anything to stop it . Right as the rest of my chest dissappeared the bar filled up completely to 100 % . The blue box now said `` shutting down '' seconds later i saw big white letters appear suddenly in the middle of the black emptyness <newline> UPDATE FAILED <newline> SYSTEM CORRUPTED <newline> ERROR <newline> ERROR <newline> ERROR <newline> ERROR <newline> ERROR <newline> ERROR <newline> ERROR <newline> ERROR <newline> ERROR <newline> ERROR <newline> SYSTEM CRASH <newline> <newline> And that was the last thing I remember , I explained to my brother . <newline> `` Well shit all i know is we took that acid then i went to shower and when i came back you were passedd out on the couch with an empty m & m package on you '' ."

Lee looks resentful at the last remark , but seems determined to tell me what she came for . <newline> <newline> She looks up at me , all the timidness I saw before now behind her . `` I need you to be my boyfriend .

She takes a quick step back to dodge it . <newline> <newline> I shrug , saying , `` why would I do that ?

    "target": "Amidst the gory clash of titans , I trembled in fear . Around me the roar of warriors twice my size filled the air as their weapons clattered and clamored against metal and wood . Huge beasts of burden bellowed as they trampled the enemy and were cut down in battle . The field was awash in bodies of the slain , both sides indistinguishable in death . A wall of combatants surrounded me , parting only momentarily to show the sea of endless turmoil . The cause was great , and this conflict had brought countless numbers on both sides , but this was not my battle . <newline> <newline> I , Sneedle , lowest of the Kemplins , barely half the height of my smallest compatriot , was not a fighter . I was always teased and bullied for my diminutive size by other younglings , and lost every skirmish . I spent my life in bruises and cuts . Cast out by my family for the disgrace of being the runt of all runts , I thought no one cared for me . But when the steely frame of the lord of darkness marched through my village , claiming to need the aid of all Kemplins , even me , I joined up for the one thing I never had , someplace to belong . I became part of something bigger . <newline> <newline> Here on the battlefield , though , I wished I was something bigger . Barely able to old the gigantic pole arm distributed to the hoard , I could only watch in slack jawed wonder as my companions took on steel clad giants one on one , their tremendous blows sending sparks spraying . One blow would be the end of poor Sneedle , but somehow I was beneath notice , invisible in a storm of violence . <newline> <newline> Then came the most fearsome moment of my life…the sea of swords parted and toward me stormed Reygold , the legendary leader of the Rublites . Striding in armor so polished , light blazed off every surface , he slashed his way through the combatants . His tremendous blade turned away every Krempkin lance and cleaved unarmored enemies in twain . Nothing deterred him from his target , and his target , poor Sneedle , was not wearing armor . My blood ran cold and my tiny body betrayed me . I struggled to raise my halberd , but my aching muscles only trembled . <newline> <newline> I watched as my waking nightmare strode confidently forward . His shimmering shield discarded as he raised his mighty two handed sword , twice the length of any Kemplin . I swallowed and was prepared to meet the maker as his last stride put him within striking distance . Then with a strength of spirit twice my size , I swung back my ungainly pole arm , ready to meet him blow for blow . The halberd suddenly stopped , and so did my polished persecutor with the glossy gleam . Slowly his shouldered blade sank to the ground and all fighting seemed to pause as I watched the greatest opponent kneel before me . My heart skipped a beat as the thunk of a cudgel lightly grazed my back . Slowly I turned , surrounded by a sea of staring faces , and came face to face with Grax , the king of eternal night , propped slack armed with the head of my halberd embedded in his neck . With one swing , I killed our king . <newline> <newline> Weapons were dropped , sheathed , and suddenly forgotten in the arms of bewildered warriors as they realized that the battle was over . The champion of the opposing army looked up at me , asking my name . I stammered in reply . He snatched me up and hoisted me high , shouting my name . The other silvery clad giants echoed the chant until all of the shining sea sounded , “ Sneedle , Sneedle , Sneedle ! ” And that was how I became the greatest hero of any age by single-handedly ending the conflict of the seven nations ."

I was honestly a little bit surprised with how many people were in the theater after the explosive news from Sony , but that did not matter , I was going to see this movie . After a few moments of searching the packed theater for a seat , I finally found one in the perfect spot ! <newline> <newline> I push my way past the crowd , and get nice and cozy next to my new 2 hour neighbor who had his back turned . He turned around once he felt my optimistic presence , which quickly turned to fear , as it was a fhurious Kim Jong-Un , the supreme leader and co-star of The Interview . good ole Kimmy , as I would later call him , did not look too pleased , and I was not too sure why , but I knew one thing was for sure , no one would blow up a theater with such a huge star in it . <newline> <newline> Before the lights dimmed and the previews started , I leaned next to Kim , and asked him if he could break a $ 50 because I wanted popcorn but only had big bills . Kim turned , and glared at me for 30 long awkward seconds , then pulled out his wallet and gave me a $ 20 two $ 10s and a $ 5 , thinking he might of miscounted I asked about the other 5 dollars . After some heckling , Kim gave me 5 $ 1s , and I proceeded to concessions . <newline> <newline> While I was there , I thought about how nice it was for Kim to break the fifty , so I sprung for the bottomless popcorn and drink combo to share with him , and with my last $ .50 got us gumballs . After all you do not want your theater neighbor to hate you . <newline> <newline> I make it back to the theater , and share the good news with Kim . Finally a smile cracked on that porcelain face of his ! I did n't want to bring up what was making him so mad , but there were some thoughts that ran across my mind . <newline> <newline> Later in the movie , it was finally Kim 's big moment , and I suddenly realized why he was so mad . The damn writers made the innocent Kim `` Kimmy Jong-Un some huge antagonist in this huge motion picture , and gave him a terrible look ! I sensed the anger coming from Kim when the entire audience booed and yelled at the screen version of him , I looked at him and noticed that the anger turned to sadness . <newline> <newline> A single tear rolled down that adorable chubby face of his , and I was speechless , but knew I needed to reconcile with him , so I tried to find the right encouraging words , and I think I found them `` Do n't worry Kim , if only they knew this you the real you , not the you propaganda has crafted you to be , then they would not hate you . '' <newline> <newline> Kim 's eyes swelled up , and he said through deep breathes `` you can call me Kimmy , and thank you for the encouraging words /u/fruitbythefootfucker you are welcome at /r/pyongyang anytime you want . '' <newline> <newline> After we had a great bro moment , we continued to watch the movie , and it turned out Kimmy found it really hilarious and invited me , James Franco , and Seth Rogan to /r/pyongyang to smoke a bowl and feast on the best food North Korea had to offer ."

Pfft , 'Pays good ' I say to myself as I throw my cigarette out the window , seeing the truck ahead in the distance , waiting ominously in the field . <newline> <newline> I hear whoever this guy is in the truck moving about , attempting to cry for help with the duct tape over his mouth , <newline> <newline> `` ITS NO USE KID , STOP STRUGGLING , IT 'LL BE DONE SOON '' I shout back to him . <newline> <newline> They always do struggle I think to myself , survival and fear is a powerful cocktail when somebody realises they might not live to see tomorrow .

    "prompt": "In an alternate universe , gunpowder was never invented . What does warfare look like ?",
    "prediction": "never really is a fantasy... who never invented? The never thought?...?.....",
    "target": "Preface : The power of the gun is that it can be used by anyone with nil experience whereas a skilled bowmen or a skilled swordsman can beat a very high number of unskilled users . <newline> <newline> The advent of gunpowder-based weapons did not sweep the world , leading to most of the old world monarchies to remain in power . This highly stifled invention . Which in turn led to a lower population rate . The Americas was not desolated by explorers bringing germs and guns . Without the power of guns , the small number of conquisitors were not able to upheave large settlements such as the Aztecs . Germs played a smaller portion as the explorers and to-be conquerors did not make it very far in-land , mitigating the affects of disease spread . Chemical warfare is nearly non-existent , as they do not distinguish friend from foe . And knowledge about chemical warfare is highly sanctioned and restricted . <newline> <newline> The Spanish Monarchy went bankrupt after funding colonization . The people of Spain has since then become a sovereign nation under the flag of the Castille , an attempt to unite the people under a common flag . <newline> <newline> Literacy rates for grade-level reading is roughly at 60 % . Most people do not need to know how to read as most of the population are in labor-intensive work instead of white-collar jobs . <newline> <newline> Steam-engine boats and steam-tanks are relatively new . The mining of coal has just recently begun less than half a century ago . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> December 2014 , <newline> <newline> Another telegram from the colonies overseas . New Amsterdam has made a treaty with the Five Nations . The treaty demands for the evacuation of all civilians back to their respected lands . It looks like the ferocity of the Indians has trumped our will to civilize . Good riddance . All those tax-dollars being poured to fund an impossible mission . I am glad to have that over with , especially when there is another front that needs more attention to . <newline> <newline> The Ottoman are being rowdy again and are setting up encampments along the Danube . The German Reich is asking the soereign nations of Europe to unite in order to repel against the foreign invaders . The French Foreign Legionaires have already been committed to fighting the southern front along with the Kingdom of Castille . Most of the fighting is over at the Strait of Gilbraltar , but raiding parties are all along the shorelines . <newline> <newline> The Italians , with the assistance of pirate groups , are wrestling against the Ottoman for control of the Mediterranean Sea . The Ottoman naval fleet is vast and wield stronger firepower . It is just a matter of time before they take full control of the Mediterranean Sea , which would be an unfavorable scene for both the Italians and pirate groups . No room for corruption among the Ottoman . Their piety gives them strength . <newline> <newline> If the Ottoman want to stake claim to any more territory , they must strike now before the navy and armies of the Commonwealth are restocked and ready to be re-deployed . They must strike soon . And because of so , I must return to training my brigade . <newline> <newline> I meander toward the training grounds . Walking down the long hall , the faint sound of armored marching men begins to emerge . These are the foot soldiers . They are pushed to the front of the line , to be baptized in blood in the clashing of steel . They wear armor of full steel . They carry a heavy shield and a saber , and alongside they have a dagger and a throwing axe . These men must first learn to lay down their lives before they are trained to fight . <newline> <newline> As I turn the corridor , I begin to hear the sound of blunt sabers meeting . These training blades are not sharp , but will still be likely to cut you if you are not attentive . Swordsmanship plays a key role . Each of these men in the battleground are currently training with one shield , one saber . These people can reign from anyone , from a new recruit to an old-time veteran . Different people have their different weapon choices . The most proven for those are the sword and saber combination . I watch the combatants as they spar each other . The more training they do now , the less likely they will fall victim on the battlefields . They must train and learn to thirst for defeat now so they can survive the battlefield when that time comes . <newline> <newline> I comment on the combatants and correct their mistakes before moving onward . I walk away from the main training grounds and go toward the archery range nearby . These archers train not only for precision , but for speed and endurance . They must be able to consitently fire six shots per minute for ten minutes in order to be effective . These bowmen are the back-of-the-line . They are used mostly to deter cavalary from engaging early on so the footsoldiers have time to writtle down the numbers . Cavalry have very light armor in comparison to the footsoldiers , but what they trade off in armor they gain in mobility . They are veteran fighters . Horses are few and can be very effective . But horse armor is difficult and expensive , thus armored horses are very unlikely . And if you hit a horse , the rider usually will fall off . I watch as they are given instructions . I approve and continue onward . <newline> <newline> Next is the special training grounds ."

One thing ive learned after 21 years , you never know whats gon na come through that gate . '' <newline> <newline> Sitting in the shop one day a man walks in . Comes straight to the counter and lays a giant broad sword on the table . Im taken a bit aback by how forward he is . `` What do we have here ? '' I ask already knowing the title of the sword on my countertop . `` This , is the original 'excaliber ' '' he says trying to make it sound wonderous . I pick up the world and inspect it a little . Ornately crafted , but still battle worthy , the sword is old enough to be excaliber . `` Mind if I call in an expert ? I have a buddy who knows all about these old swords . '' I ask the man who agrees . A few minutes later an old wizard walks into the store `` Merlin ! '' I saw sounding glad to see an old business partner . Merlin strides up the the table and picks up the sword unceremoniously inspects it . `` Hmm ... its a good fake . Definitely not the real deal . But certain collectors like recreations . Plus it 's definitely battle worthy . One of these would sell on the market for ... '' there 's a long pause as the man waits in anticipation . `` 5 gold pieces . '' The man looks angry . `` This is the real deal . My great grandfather pulled it from the stone himself ! '' Merlin with a twinkle in his eye laughs and says `` who do you think made the thing . I did . Watch , the real excaliber will stick into the ground and only the true heir will be able to pull it out , if you are his descendant you should be able to pull it free . '' After a bit more discussion we got outside and merlin slams the sword into the ground . The man pulls it free with no problem and says `` see ! ? '' Merlin taking the sword and plunging it back to the earth says `` that proves nothing . '' As he gestures for me to pull it out . One good tug and the sword is free . The man looking defeated says `` just give me 6 gold pieces and its yours . '' I inspect the sword a bit and say `` I can sell it for 5 . Best I can do for you is 2 . '' The man sighs and says `` sure.. 2 is good . '' I give him his gold pieces and he goes on his way . Walking inside with merlin i ask `` How did you know id be able to pull it out ? '' Merlin chuckles , the sword doesnt stick unless I put a spell on it . Should fetch a fine price . I can expect my usual finders fee ? '' Shrugging i reply `` yeah , yeah 1 % . '' As I put the sword in the case labeled 'The real excaliber : 50,000 gold pieces . ' <newline> <newline> As I finish a man walks up and says he 's got something I might be interested in . I follow him outside and as I see it I find myself repeating my old motto . `` I do n't do seige weapons .

'' `` Big haus , what are you gon na do with a trebuchet ? '' `` Who knows I might throw a giant wooden rabbit over the castle walls .

I paid them a fair wage , so that they could support themselves and their families . '' <newline> <newline> `` An army that sacked and pillaged towns at will ! The wages you paid came from your army 's plunder ! '' The Hero roared at me . <newline> <newline> I shrugged . `` Yes , and I do n't deny it . As I said , these men were desperate , because the harvests have been poor , and there simply is n't enough food to go around . Do you expect them to simply starve ? Do you expect them to simply wither away ? We took the food and the resources we found in the surrounding towns and villages . It was either that or die of starvation . Like I said , desperate . '' <newline> <newline> The Hero raised his sword and pointed the tip of the steel at me , `` You 're despicable . You condemned those villagers to their own starvation . Your army stole the harvests that they never worked for . Not one day did they toil in the fields or pastures . What gives them the right to live off the labors of others ? '' <newline> <newline> I smirked , `` And how is that different from what you do ? Have you ever labored in the fields or the pastures ? Do you not eat grain and meat that you never worked for ? Or do you feel entitled to such sustenance simply because you are good with a sword ? '' <newline> <newline> The Hero glared at me silently for a few moments before speaking , `` I do not take my food by force . It is given to me as payment for the protection I offer and for the evils I slay . '' <newline> <newline> I laughed in his face , then said , `` Do you truly believe that ? Do you truly believe that no one has ever looked upon your blade and your build , and then given you their dinner out of fear ? Do you truly believe no one would ever see you as the bully come to deprive them of what 's theirs ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I ... '' the Hero stammered , hesitantly , `` I do not ... '' <newline> <newline> The Hero was suddenly cut off by a spear thrust into his back . It passed through his body entirely until the bloody tip protruded from his breast . He looked down at the wound in his front , then craned his neck back to look behind him . One of my surviving guards had managed to sneak up on him , and had taken advantage of his distraction to deal a fatal blow . <newline> <newline> The Hero 's sword slipped from his slack fingers and dropped to the stone floor with a loud clang . He sank to his knees . I stood from my throne and slowly approached the dying man . `` I hope , in your last moments , that you can realize you and I are not so different . It 's just that where you are an idealist , I am a realist . Where you are unwilling to accept the evils you have done , I fully acknowledge the misdeeds I have committed . Where you see yourself as the hero of your tale , I see that there are no heroes , only villains . ''"

Echoes of rock music flooded the night sky and soon disipated into the air . There was n't any neighbors within 5 miles so no one was being disturbed . Geoffrey approached the house emerging from the tree line . <newline> <newline> `` It 's October , it has to be a Halloween party ! '' said Geoffrey excitedly as he slid his mask down onto his face and tightened the straps on the back so when dancing it would n't fall off . <newline> <newline> Geoffrey walked closer to the house , creeping because he knew the best way to enter was a surprise entrance . `` They must 've forgotten my invite . Of course they 'd invite me , I 'm their closest neighbor . I mean , I live in the shed behind their house in the woods and they were chanting my favorite saying earlier . It 's a no brainer . '' He surveyed the teens inside and noticed all the usual characters that he has seen before . There was that guy who loved smoking weed Kyle . That sexy girl who wants to have a good time and is free spirited Tonya . `` Oh shit ! Fucking Blake is here ! He 's the coolest motherfucker alive ! '' Geoffrey exclaimed whispering to himself and gave a quick fist pump . `` So excited ! Oh look , they 're not even dancing ? Probably too bright in there . I 'll change that '' Geoffrey went to the back of the house and disabled the main electricity from the electric box . <newline> <newline> `` Now , what 's a way in to surprise them the best ? '' He looked up at the top of the house and thought 'No ladder ' and then towards the basement that had a window slightly ajar . `` That 's it ! I 'll sneak into the basement and pop through the door and shout 'Who 's ready to partay ? ! ' . It will be so awesome '' said Geoffrey as he climbed through the window . <newline> <newline> `` I ca n't see shit down here '' Geoffrey exclaimed as he stumbled and tried to adjust his eyes . Suddenly , he heard a cat screech and jump in the distance and saw someone move . 'Oh , no ' Geoffrey thought to himself . 'Someone 's trying to rob these guys . I have to do something ' and looked down to find an axe handle right next to his leg . He picked it up and crept closer to the figure . By this time , he could see the outline of the person due to the moonlight shining in through the basement window . Geoffrey poised himself and choked up on the handle . Geoffrey played baseball when he was younger at the local camp and knew that the firmer the grip , the more control you had of your swing . <newline> <newline> Geoffrey positioned himself , crouched down and readied his swing . 'Too close ' he thought and reset up backing up slightly . He stuck his tongue through the hole in his mask , licked his finger and mimicked Babe Ruth testing the air . `` Aim for the fences '' he said as the person turned around . Geoffrey swung as hard as he could and closed his eyes . `` No one steals from my friends ! '' Normally , the swing would have had a flow through and his arms would have went from his right side to his left but about half way through , he felt a sudden jerk and his arms stopped . Geoffrey opened his eyes and looked in front of him . As soon as he opened his eyes , a warm mist of wetness hit the open areas of his face . <newline> <newline> `` What the fuck ? '' Geoffrey did n't realize that the axe handle actually had the axe head on the end of it and was staring at it submerged into the side of Blakes head . `` Oh , shit ! Oh shit ! Oh shit ! I 'm sorry Blake ! Fuck I 'm so sorry ! ''"

He watched the street as he lit up . No sign of the van yet . He smoked two more cigarettes , flicking the butts into the road , ignored by the many cars and panel trucks . It was getting colder and starting to drizzle lightly . The misty rain made yellow halos around the street lights . Billy waited another half an hour before looking at the cheap watch on his left wrist . Then he walked a little farther and turned down a warehouse alley to urinate . <newline> <newline> There was a group of five dingy looking kids , maybe ten or eleven years old , playing dice . They all looked up at Billy hesitantly . Billy raised his hands . `` Hey , no problem . You guys playing for cash ? '' <newline> <newline> A tall kid , his hair in a low fade , said , `` maybe .

'' Was all he could say before dashing down the alley , his group scrambling to follow . Billy made to grab the slowest , a chubby short kid wearing a puffy jacket . The chubby kid yelled out as Billy collared him . His friends turned back , unsure momentarily before fleeing . Billy knew he did n't have long before they 'd come back with much bigger kids . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not gon na hurt ya , chubby . '' The boy was blubbering now . Billy gave him a smart slap . `` Just need information . Got a question . Okay ? '' The boy nodded . `` Okay . Looking for a van , red with yellow stripes down the sides . Little circle windows on the sides . Seen it ? Maybe a weird guy in a leather jacket driving ? Carrying little kid sized packages ? '' The kid began blubbering more deeply . Billy jerked him closer and stuck his face in the boy 's view and yelled , `` shut the fuck up and answer me you fat shit crack baby . '' The scared boy began crying full force now so Billy punched him in the stomach , knocking the wind out of him . `` Jesus , almost did n't get my hand back . You need to eat some vegetables .

He glanced at the boy before fishing out a crumpled dollar and tossing it to his feet . `` Buy yourself an apple , fatso . '' He turned and walked back out of the alley . <newline> <newline> By the time he reached the street he needed the rain had increased beyond a drizzle and Billy walked hunched and wet . By the time he reached the one time Eastern Fish warehouse , his bladder felt like it was on the verge of its own involuntary rainfall . He stood for a moment , looking at the red van with yellow stripes , then unzipped and peed against the tire . The van blocked the view from the lighter traffic on the street .

You could say I 've been waiting to hear that words for eight hundred years . Did humanity really took eight hundred years to find cure for nano-machine viral infection ? I pondered .

He alone was donned in red . As he raised himself up from the chair , the men in black knelt before him . <newline> <newline> The man in red , who seemed to be the leader of the group , opened his arm in welcome and said : `` Ah , my liver .

The butterflies stopped taunting him with their lazy twirls in the cool summer breeze . Even the hawk , that could dive through the air with supreme confidence—a being so in control of its body that even the great apes of the world would pause and watch as the king of the skies soared—eventually faded to obscurity in the hazy winds of life . <newline> <newline> But , dreams die hard . As John grew older , his mind wandered . The clouds still begged him to join them in that great blue canvas . To float amongst the clouds…that would be true freedom . Only , the birds were blessed with that freedom—with the ability to cast of Earth ’ s shackles and shrug free of that massive weight . Man could not fly ; that was how it is . But , man could climb those rebellious peaks that broke free of their brothers and stretched vainly toward the sky . Why didn ’ t man climb ? <newline> <newline> And so , he bitterly asked “ Why ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Shut up and drink a beer. ” His best friend said . <newline> <newline> And , he listened . <newline> <newline> When he thought about it , climbing a mountain was dangerous . Soon , those mysterious peaks , where man danced with cloud and earth , became laced with fear and risk . Those towering spires that broke the sky , could also break a man . Even the views soon grew stale . A thousand men took a thousand pictures , most of the same thing , so that the masses did not have to . <newline> <newline> But , dreams die hard . As John started his family and waded deep into his career , his mind wandered . The true allure of the skies and flying were to be free . Now he was an adult , with money and the means ; he could still break free . The world opened to those who asked , and it could all be his . The sights , the journeys , and that primal freedom could all be his . All this , and more , for the traveler , all while still safely abiding Earthen chains . Why didn ’ t men travel ? <newline> <newline> And so , he bitterly asked “ Why ? ” <newline> <newline> “ John . We talked about this . You have a family now . You have responsibilities. ” His wife said . <newline> <newline> And , He listened . <newline> <newline> In a flash , the thought passed—just a vague fancy on a floating breeze to tickle his mind . Without him his family would wither . It wasn ’ t long before any thought of leaving home left a panic : how would his children get by ? What would his wife do ? Who would take care of his home , his car , his life ? <newline> <newline> Dreams die hard , but over time , all must fade . Even dreams , the most immortal of man ’ s creations , must eventually succumb ; it is the Earthly curse . Those heavy chains , that titanic burden , will crush even the most resolute of heart . As time wore on , John lived his life . His mind did not wander , until the day he lay on his death bed , when his own prisons were at their weakest . He saw a lone butterfly settle on the windowsill , and that childhood wish came drifting back . To fly , to be free of his broken body , would be heaven . Why didn ’ t man fly ? <newline> <newline> And so , he bitterly asked “ Why ? ” <newline> <newline> Only the gentle breeze came in response . <newline> <newline> This time , he listened . <newline>"

    "target": "It was thirty minutes shy of fifty years since the figure had appeared in the sky portending the death of humanity . The figure rode astride a black horse , his flaming skull affixed by the horns of a stag , like a figure out of pagan folklore . Fifty years he had given them . Fifty years to ensure that three people out of seven billion would n't die . `` Who ? '' The words had been shouted to him in every conceivable dialect . In response , he had turned and ridden away . <newline> <newline> Astrid had been a child then and did n't fully comprehend what had happened . It was n't so much the horseman , but the look on her parent 's faces that foretold how much her world would change . Their fearful gazes . Their withheld tears . Those images imprinted on her memory were where it had all begun for Astrid . <newline> <newline> Things had begun in an unlikely place . Hope . Every blog , every newspaper , every broadcast , every place that served as an outlet for opinionated discussion foresaw this as a turning point . A new era of peace and involvement for all of mankind . There were calls for funding for new medical technologies , for a mandated disarmament for all countries , for aid to be provided to impoverished nations . Anything that would not have been possible before the world had a gun held to its head . <newline> <newline> But that was only the first wave and Astrid could see it had been a childish dream . The second sent terror across the world 's countries . Radicals of every background saw the event not as a warning , but as a condemnation . A harkening back to the tale of Abraham and Sodom . Seeking to be the agents of whatever gods they swore allegiance to , people took up arms against one another slaughtering indiscriminately . <newline> <newline> They were n't the only ones . Any sick and volatile degenerate who could get their hands on a weapon saw this as an opportunity . A way to leave a legacy and shape the world in a way that would have been impossible before . Astrid had spent this entire time locked in her house with her parents and it had been the worst three years of her life . <newline> <newline> At threat of extinction , governments acted with a haste that would not have seemed possible a mere five years ago . First , towns enacted martial law and barricades appeared around villages and farmers and outliers formed self-protective posses . Then counties , states , and finally countries brought the world to heel under new and often military-led programs . Personal freedoms and inalienable rights were forgotten . Or made mandatory in a way some people joked bitterly to deaf ears . <newline> <newline> The world powers formed a coalition and mandates were passed for the sake of keeping order . Any who resisted were exterminated entirely . A calculated risk , the experts called it . Provided it had n't killed any of the three , the risk seemed to pay off . Extremism and hostile governments seemed utterly absent after the culling and the world waited the next thirty five years with bated breath . <newline> <newline> The next three and a half decades had not been pleasant , but they had seen some of the positive effects of the situation . Medical research saw breakthroughs at an incredibly accelerated rate . In the wake of new medicines , people saw their lives extending into years they had n't thought they 'd had . In cases where people could n't be kept alive with medicine , iron lungs were produced in industrial quantities and set up in warehouses across the world in an effort to make sure people made it to the fifty year deadline . <newline> <newline> Third world countries saw stable governments for the first time in generations . Technological innovations were rampant . Self-driving vehicles had been implemented almost completely over a decade and roadway deaths were almost non-existent . Alcohol , cigarettes , and anything that could be abused had been effectually eliminated . Even world-wide dietary restrictions were executed and the positive impact on people 's health was immediately apparent . <newline> <newline> There were downsides to all of this . Riots sprang up as people were denied their vices but these were put down with brutal but pointedly non-lethal force . Suicide also became highly illegal with threat of discipline being enforced on the family members of those that were successful . Those that were not were often restrained in psych wards . Astrid shivered at the thought of spending thirty years in a padded room and a straight jacket . <newline> <newline> Issues that people had n't initially considered also came up . What if the three had n't been born yet ? In the wake of some sort of biblical proof , did that mean abortions could constitute murder of one of the chosen ones . The governments decided not to take any risks and made abortions illegal , but offered free sterilization in its place . If they could be judged on the possibility of someone being born or not , they may as well give up now . <newline> <newline> Although the years had stretched into timelessness , the day was finally here . Judgment day . At the second of the appointed time , the sky darkened and the horseman appeared . Everyone saw him in exactly the same way from where they stood in the streets or leaned out of windows . He gazed down at them wordlessly . Then he drew a sword from a belt on his side and pointed it towards the heavens . Three beams of light shown"

Landed me in the hospital for a week and killed my gf . I did n't even have that many . Two beers is apparently more than I could handle with the rain . <newline> <newline> All that was two years ago and I still ca n't seem to let it go . My buddy Dave keeps encouraging to go out and be social again but I do n't know . I worry how Alison would feel about me trying to date again . Before the accident , we would often talk at length about our futures together . We had it all planned out . Could I really let myself become entangled with someone else 's life like I did with Alison ? <newline> <newline> I guess tonight I 'll find out ... . <newline> <newline> As I arrived to the bar Dave had invited me to , my focus was instantly drawn to a girl at the bar . It did n't appear that she was with anyone and no one was talking to her . My attention was suddenly grabbed . <newline> <newline> `` Dude , you really need to loosen up some . Try to have some fun . '' said Dave . <newline> Apologetically , I said , `` Sorry . I 'm just trying to focus . '' I did n't want to ruin Dave 's evening as well as my own . <newline> `` All you got to do is go talk to her man . '' <newline> Surprised , I said , `` What are you talking about ? '' <newline> Without missing a beat , Dave replied , `` You 've been staring at the bar since we got here . I 'm not sure who you 're checking out but if you do n't ask , you 'll never know . '' <newline> <newline> Dave was right . I could n't live my life alone forever . Alison would n't want that for me . I like to think she would have wanted me to be happy more than anything else . So I decided to make a move . <newline> <newline> The closer I got to her , the more familiar she looked . Her hair mainly as I had n't been able to get a good look at her face but something just seemed familiar to me . <newline> <newline> `` Mind if sit here ? '' I asked but she just continued to stare forward or down at her drink . Maybe she just did n't hear me . <newline> <newline> After a while I finally got the courage to try to talk to her . Amazing what I little alcohol will do for confidence . <newline> <newline> `` My name 's Robert . You come here often or just here with friends ? '' I said . <newline> Again , she just stared down at her drink but slightly turned her head so I could see more of her face . I was shocked . <newline> <newline> `` Alison ? ! '' I said . <newline> At this , the woman started to get up and walk away but I stopped her . She turned to look at me . <newline> `` I 'm not who you think I am . Just leave me alone . '' she said somberly . <newline> She was right . It was n't Alison . Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me . At this I just sat back down at the bar and ordered another drink . <newline> `` Did you see her too ? '' said a timid voice to my right . I looked over to reply and I was awestruck . A beautiful woman that had to be around my age was sitting on the stool the right of the mystery woman that had been there before . <newline> `` Yeah , I thought she was someone else . '' I said . <newline> `` I did too . What a coincidence ! The thing is no one else seems to have noticed her . '' <newline> `` What do you mean ? '' <newline> `` I 've been coming here for a month now and she 's always here . Day or night . Same barstool . Same clothes . '' <newline> Interested , I said , `` But how do you know nobody else notices her ? '' <newline> Looking a little annoyed at this , she said , `` I asked the bartender one night and he looked at me like I was a nutball . I did n't want to raise a huge stink about it but how could he not see her . He was standing right in front of her . Tonight was the first time I 've ever seen her move either besides just her head . '' <newline> <newline> After exchanging names , Margret and I talked . And talked . And talked . It 's weird how two peoples lives can be very similar . Almost everything that happened to me during my life had happened to Margret . Even the accident . her now dead boyfriend was drinking and wrecked his car the same night that I wrecked mine . <newline> Maybe Alison really does just want me to be happy afterall . <newline>"

There is more to this girl than just her hair . Maybe it was the fact that she always managed to find a way to smile without her lips ever budging , how she 'd make me smile without her even watching , or how whenever we 'd part ways she would do that little , like a hop-skip but only done with the toes . You know what I mean ? Everything about her was so inviting , so entrancing . I was enthralled by her very being . <newline> <newline> Something about her caused this- this change inside me . I do n't know what it was , but it was as if her mere existence caused me to wake up in the morning invigorated . I would wake to breathing stale air , step outside into the bog of life and systematically trudge my way through work and the day before coming home and washing the newest layer of rust from my skin . But it turns out , no really - it turns out there was all a purpose for this . There was a reason for me to build this chrysalis I had trapped myself in . I had indulged so much in the younger , what we could call caterpillar stage of my life , that I had this coming . Caterpillars , after all , are mindless monsters that only consume , leaving a wake of destruction in their path . I caused this life , and I was to be punished for it . I was alone for so long that my visage became that of stone , and remained that way for so long that the petrified face the world saw also became one that was petrified of the world . <newline> <newline> But then I met her . She is what sparked this change , this metamorphosis . This new beginning . A second chance . All of my transgressions would be shattered and erased as I finally break free from this self-made tomb , spread my wings and reach towards the world . The best part is , even if she does n't feel the same way , even if she does n't see in me what I see in her , all I care about is that I have her in my life . I can feel it already , my skin crawls with life as I find myself become reinvigorated . The cracks in the stone widen and so do my lips , reaching upwards along with my spirit . She has sprung me from my cage without even knowing it , and even if it takes my whole life I will repay her for that . <newline> <newline> Her arms were around me now , as we lay in her bed . They we 're wrapped tight around me , keeping me close . This feeling ? This change ? It was all meant for me . I was meant to be hers . She chose me , after all . The poison she put in me that first had be in my system for so long that the attraction I had was undeniable . Now I see that I was not the only monster , that there are things in this world that exist to keep it running the way it is . I feel her other six arms wrap around the rest of me now , holding me steady as she wraps me in her cocoon . I was so naive to think that just because she released me from my prison did n't mean she could n't put me in another . She holds me carefully , almost lovingly , as she weaves the web up my body . Trapped again . A new cocoon , and new metamorphosis she would help me with . My last ."

His naked hand was resting on the steam engine 's lever . `` We will discuss the histories of old during next period ; the Imperator insists that this demonstration takes place within the allocated break time . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> Quintus fell back into silence , as had the rest of the class . They had been taking in the large mechanical wonder behind their professor , pondering what it could possibly be . Brutus pushed the lever into position , revealing two massive infernos beneath the twin chambers resting on the iron platforms . The class gasped at the hidden fires , some edging away , while others edged closer . Within minutes of the reveal , steam began billowing out of exhaust vents as the four giant gears started to turn in unison . From overhead , light began to pour into the room - startling the students . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Do you understand what has just happened ? '' Brutus took no time to wait for an answer , assuming the class understood rhetorical nature of his question . `` The steam generated by the boiling of the water in the twin cauldrons was forced through a series of pipes and propellers , which in turn drove the gears to turn . '' Brutus walked over to the machine and pointed at the central gear pair , without taking a moment ’ s break from his speech . `` These two gears each drove the smaller gear beneath them to move the iron rods attached in such a manner that they wound the roof up . As you may have noticed , the roof has been replaced with collapsible bronze plating , to allow for such an event as this . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> None of the students understood the implications of a functioning steam engine , but the display had been completed , which was all Brutus cared for . His position was not to showcase the Imperator 's power , but to teach the youth of the empire the knowledge needed to separate them from the uncivilized heathens from which every direction was saturated with . `` If you have any questions , you may ask Professor Alexander , for he dabbles much more deeply in the sciences behind this than I . '' The class continued to murmur in awe of how steam was able to move metal , but it died down as the armoured hand of Brutus rose into the air as to silence them . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` So , as the impatient Quintus interjected with questions regarding past civilizations and our own histories , he will lead by setting the bar for basic knowledge that I will assume you all equally have . '' Motioning for Quintus to speak , Brutus pulled back the lever to silence the roaring fires behind him . `` Well ... I have an understanding of our rise to glory , but I 'm poorly equipped to discuss the ancients . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> Brutus knew that was a lie , but appreciated the desire to know that his class shared with him . `` Very well , we will start with the mightiest ancients we know of : The Romans , the Mongols , the Marvels , and the most recent to fall : The coalition of the Europeans , Americans , Chinese , and Russanadians , known as the Union Nations . '' Brutus walked over to a large granite globe , pointing at the southernmost portion of the Roman Leg . `` This is where the glory of civilization began , with the birth of Rome . We know very little of the immense empire , but we do know within years they conquered the world . The tales of Julius Caesar , who claimed all of Gaul , Igyt , and then ascending unto Divus Augustus to conquer a distant land called Olympus . Not only did he survive assassination , he then transformed a weak civilization into the strongest empire even known . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> Walking over to the now cooled steam engine , Brutus paused for a moment to appreciate man ’ s potential . `` This steam engine is n't even a seed compared to the vast tree of technological prowess the Romans achieved . It 's been far too many thousands of years to uncover any of their technology , but the Union Nations viewed the Romans with such unequivocal admiration , that it must 've been breathtaking . The Union Nations were able to place man not only on our once whole moon , but on Mars ! They lived among the stars , while creating life from machines and ripping apart the very fabric of our realm to use in war . Imagine what awe inspiring power the Romans must 've wielded .

Deborah had the look of a woman who was always a few minutes late for an engagement , and continuously shifted between a care-to-the-wind smile and a nervous twitch in her left cheek muscles and eye . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , thank you Deb , '' Doctor Frost said , sitting down at the dusty old desk and taking a moment to wipe the surface with a clean cloth . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm just saying , '' she shrugged , posing awkwardly next to the old office furniture . `` Did n't they say your first appointment is on Monday ? That 's hardly enough time to- '' <newline> <newline> `` Just because Brainwaves are faster does n't mean I 'm incapable of reading a manual , '' Frost laughed , opening his briefcase and pulling out a pair of inch-thick recycled-paper manuals . `` Besides , a little old-fashioned reading and learning never hurt anyone .

'' she promised . <newline> <newline> The doctor allowed himself a long breath , at first enjoying the relative silence of the room without his intern chattering on ... but then another breath to take in the smell of real paper . God ... had it been that long since he held any ? As he mentally skimmed through the last twenty years of his practice he realized that tablets , e-ink and PDAs had pretty much handled the bulk of his work , education and leisure . Real paper , well , that was only for the occasional rare first-edition print or a sentimental greeting card . <newline> <newline> Then , as he adjusted his glasses and gazed down at the books in front of him , his smile faded . `` Nerve Dynamics D-Seven-Nine-Nine-Two Operator 's manual , '' he whispered out loud and opened the front page , skimming the disclaimers and dedications and thank yous and all the usual drivel that you could never do in a Brainwave session . He smirked at that and wondered how many high-school graduates could still recite all the publisher 's names from every course they downloaded ... likely all of them . What a nice way to be immortalized in a generation 's subconscious . <newline> <newline> As he began reading , though , he forced fanciful thought from his mind and applied his surgeon 's focus and memory to every word and every detail . He had to . It was the only way he would be able to sleep tonight and the many nights to come . <newline> <newline> Deborah came back in , pushing a squeaky-wheeled contraption under a white sterile cover . `` Got it ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Good . Sit down . You 're going to have to read these manuals too if you 're going to be my intern . '' <newline> <newline> Deb groaned , looking at the book in his hand and realizing there was no escape now that her mentor was a good dozen pages in . `` Doc , listen ... I 'm serious . I can load this up on a Wavedrive and we can get this out of the way within two hours ! Come on , do n't you want to go home early and play with your kids ? You 're not even on the clock yet . '' <newline> <newline> He turned the page and motioned for her to bring the contraption closer . She complied , but not without expending a lot of effort to seem bored . It faded for a moment when he pulled back the sheet and began comparing the diagrams to the actual physical device . `` I told you , Deb . This one is important . I do n't want any portion of this process to be given away to a computer . '' <newline> <newline> Deb reached up and rubbed her cheek , which seemed to be suddenly twitching a little more than usual , likely wondering if she could use it as an excuse to go home . In the end , though , the med-school credit and the curiosity of seeing such an archaic device won out and she pulled up a chair on the opposite side of the desk . `` Why ? '' <newline> <newline> Doctor Frost looked up from the book , finishing another pair of pages . `` What do you mean ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , I mean , why are you so worried about learning this yourself ? Someone 's already learned it and recorded the process . And it 's not like it 's that difficult , is it ? You 've learned a thousand procedures by Brainwave , have n't you ? Life-or-death ones , too . I 've watched you do three heart transplants !

Though this was normal for many children , when he turned 10 , other children would think he was too weird to hang out with , only making him need this companion more . <newline> <newline> He was an octopus-like creature covered in dark , red hair except for where his eyes and suction cups were . On the end of each of his tentacles , he had monkey-like hands with long fingers he would use to tickle Johnny . The monster 's favorite activity was to talk and he would often try to tell Johnny stories . When he was smaller , he always thought they were boring , but after a few years , Johnny became mesmerized with the monster 's stories about a landscape where there were no more humans and the legends on what happened to them . <newline> <newline> Though he would talk about many things , the monster would never say his name , no matter how many times Johnny asked him . Eventually , after being sick of calling him `` monster '' , Johnny asked him , <newline> <newline> `` Do you like the name Danny ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , there is an actor that I like named Danny . A short , bald , and fat man whom I 've been told has a voice similar to mine . He is funny . Yes , I guess I like that name . Why do you ask , John ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're Danny now .

'' He asked with his pale blue eyes looking humorously as Johnny . <newline> <newline> `` No , I just like the name Danny . '' So from then on , the monster 's name was Danny . <newline> <newline> Johnny 's parents were not usually around . His father would work until Johnny was asleep and his mother would usually have to go clean other people 's houses . However , every morning , Johnny 's mother and father would come into his room and give him a kiss on the forehead . One time , after that had happened , Danny had said , <newline> <newline> `` I wish they did not have to work as much .

Outside , where there had once been tall grasses and cotton fields were now desert . Johnny jumped from his bed immediately , screaming and crying . Danny , reached out from under Johnny 's bed and picked him up off of the floor with his long arms . <newline> <newline> `` Danny ! It 's all gone ! Mom , Dad , everything ! '' <newline> <newline> `` I know . '' Is all he said . <newline> <newline> For that first day , Johnny did not do anything . He did not move from his bed , he did not eat , and he did not even talk to Danny , as though he had been betrayed . Maybe he had ! <newline> <newline> `` How did you know , Danny ? '' Johnny asked , almost starting to cry again . <newline> <newline> `` John , I felt it , like a part of my body . '' Danny said as he got out from underneath his resting place to get a better look at his friend . He pointed in between his eyes , which Johnny now realized were bloodshot . <newline> <newline> `` I feel it here , like a headache or a tumor . When I woke up I knew they were gone . I 'm just glad you 're still here . '' He paused . `` Actually , it 's only you . '' Johnny was taken aback . <newline> <newline> `` Everything 's dead ? ! '' <newline> <newline> `` No , John .

We can not waste anything . '' Danny did not eat or drink anything , but then again , he never had before . <newline> <newline> They spent that first week together alone in the house .

I feel like I 'm finally living . <newline> I look back to the disc and see a map , directing me to a body not too far from where I currently sit . <newline> `` This is an invitation '' , I murmur to myself , barely being able to speak . <newline> My first thought is to take this to the council . All Phoalian discoveries must go through the council . But my second thought , the dangerous thought , will not stop shouting in the back of my head . It could be me . I could be the one to accept this intergalactic invitation . Up to this point , I am no extraordinary traveller . I work a menial job , live in a menial spec . When I dissipate , no one will grieve.. no one will even notice . I , Menomias Phoalian , have done nothing worth living for . <newline> But today I will . <newline> <newline> <newline> This is my first submission here , so I hope you enjoy ."

Now stop being so dramatic and sit down. ” As Brackson sat back in his chair defeated , Aster rose and crossed the study to the decanter set and poured a tall whiskey . <newline> “ Now my inside man believes that you will be reporting to the commissioners that you completed your task and that we will be splitting your $ 3.5million dollar paycheck three ways , and I disappear. ” Aster moved across the room and handed Brackson the nearly full glass of whiskey . “ So you are going to double cross him ? ” Brackson asked . “ Precisely , Very good Brackson . But he won ’ t be able to do anything because he ’ ll be in prison ” . <newline> <newline> Aster lowered himself back into his chair and continued . “ The deal is , you and I split the $ 15.6 million . All you need to do is testify before a jury , plead guilty to attempted murder at the behest of the commissioners , and I will ensure that you get a maximum of two years behind bars and parole. ” “ And how are you going to ensure that ? ” Brackson scoffed . “ I know"

A pretty depressing place if you ask me but thankfully we started a project to bring a little bit of joy into the world of these children . Once a week the kids get to meet their favourite superhero , in person , hear stories , ask questions , if they are well enough they can go out for a couple of hours , the whole deal . <newline> Today is the worst day to be hungover , it 's summertime and the sun is burning relentlessly on the building making it unbearably hot . The air was heavy and humid , sweat was dripping from my forehead . If I exercised more it would probably be easier to cope with the climate but the job , my 2 dogs and the Superherofoundation meetings did n't leave much time for a private life . <newline> I pushed past Superman in the hallway and there I stood in front of Tyron 's doors . <newline> I took a deep breath and went to knock on the door . <newline> Tyron was an incredibly smart teenager , used to be involved in a lot of sports and volunteered at the youth centre every Friday afternoon . The finest example for a perfect kid . <newline> Over the years I developed a strong bond with Tyron , I knew him from the moment he walked through these doors the first time , ready to start his first round of chemotherapy , remission , another round of chemo and another . He was always polite , almost cheery and he fought like a lion but now after three years there were no options left , he was dying . <newline> I entered the room , Tyron staring at me blankly . <newline> `` Tyron I know you 're upset , I am so so sorry !

Or maybe see a different part of the world with the Flash ? We can organise that in a heartbeat '' <newline> Tyron stared at me , with bloodshot eyes , his eyeballs seemed to retreat into their sockets , leaving big blue bags underneath them , his once athletic body seemed frail all of a sudden . <newline> `` I want to have the last say over my body '' , he exclaimed. `` I do n't want to lie here waiting for the inevitable ! Why do horrible people get more than 60 years and I will barely get 17 ? Why do I have to wait helplessly until my body destroys itself ? If this is really supposed to be it I want to take my chances . I want to gamble my life . I want to meet the Joker and if I win he takes my life while I 'm still sane and not shitting my pants and uttering nonsense , if I loose I will abide your stupid rules and wait for my end . <newline> But I want a chance ! '' <newline> Stunned by this demand I was lost for words , I felt hot and cold simultaneously and my intestines cramped up even worse than before , I must have lost all colour in my face before I managed to stutter `` The Joker ? ! '' Now the words were flowing out of my mouth like an unstoppable stream `` that is impossible , he is not part of the program ! How would we even get a hold of him ? If we could how would we convince him to come here and most definitely be arrested and put behind bars for the rest of his life . With this request you are putting everyone in this hospital in danger !

And my superiors were still assigning angels to him ? *It is our mission , * they said , *to protect all humans , even ones not worthy of it . * They just did n't see the bigger picture , that the two most powerful species on Earth had gone missing because of this twelve year-old boy . But I had to accept the role . <newline> <newline> With a lowly sigh , I entered his bedroom through the window and turned to face a black-haired Derrick , who was situated in a gray chair in front of a TV . He had headphones on , and was yelling into the microphone as though he were the only person in the house . Suddenly angered , I snapped my fingers , shutting off his TV and console . Confused , he clicked a few buttons on his controller , checked the console itself , which I was forcing to stay off , and then he whirled around , only to jump when coming face to face with me . <newline> <newline> His reaction to me was n't what I expected . Based on my siblings ' tales , I thought he would be *less* surprised to see me , not more , but the subtle glint in his grass-green eyes was not boredom , but fear . <newline> <newline> `` Who are you ?

How was this possible ? <newline> <newline> `` If you did not take my siblings , '' I hissed , `` then who did ?

The diner just like the customers that kept it open ; worn out , frayed , but full of memories . As he entered the door , the cook and two patrons stopped arguing baseball and looked towards the door . `` Frank ! '' the cook shouted , `` It 's been so long , I thought you moved . I 'll have your food right up ! '' and with that the cook disappeared in the back before Frank could say anything . Frank slumped in his usual booth over looking the street . As he sat , he interrupted a layer of dust particles , and they angerly floated away to a new resting spot . <newline> <newline> After a few minutes of car watching , the cook laid two plates down on the table . Frank was n't able to explain his wife would n't be joining him anymore . `` Enjoy ! I gave the lady a little less mayo , just the way she likes it ! '' and before Frank could retaliate , another regular appeared and the cook jetted off to greet him . Frank stared at the accidental sandwich and wondered what he would do with it . He did not have to wonder long as a young boy plopped on the booth across from him , disturbing the freshly settled dust . `` How 's it going mister !

The soothing liquid poured through my hair , across my scalp and down over my eyelids , tickling my skin and fraying my nerves . The pain internal , forgotten in the moment of pure exalted sensation . I could feel capillaries opening and allowing that smooth rush of blood course just under my skin ; the subtle jerking motion of my heart pump a constant massage of my sanity . <newline> <newline> Advil too , Advil helped as well . Can only stay in the shower for so long before that steamed water turns to ice . <newline> <newline> Gods , another night lost to the blissful dark of unconsciousness . <newline> <newline> I checked my phone , no messages , that was good , probably .

Okay , okay , that 's good . I have n't been arrested yet , so at least no one knows something happened last night yet . I need to get this out of my car , I need to get rid of the body . Cantrall reserve , that 's where it needs to go , it 's like a hundred and fifty square miles of nature reserve in there , but I need time . Work , what about work ?

    "target": "I still do n't know quite what to think about that week . Neither does Foxfire , and it 's been over forty years . <newline> <newline> For reasons owing to politics , misogyny , diplomatic relationships between duchies , and a well-meaning but totally misguided attempt by my father to keep my awful uncle 's hands to himself , my father , the king , had me sent to a remote cloistered convent called the Red Tower . As you might imagine , the building is made of red limestone . <newline> <newline> The nuns are not the stereotypical humble women in headscarves ... quite the opposite . They are the inconvenient women : too loud , too smart , too powerful , too well-educated , and , well , some of them will never consent to having a husband , if you get what I mean . The powerful men who control the Duchy could not keep their control of the Duchy if they did n't keep these women quiet , so at the first hint of any sign of independence , the daughters of the wealthy , genteel men get packed up and sent on a red horse ( it 's traditional ) to the Red Tower , never to enter polite society again . <newline> <newline> The nuns ' hands are not idle . Every inch of the Tower is covered in artwork , from carvings and frescoes to tapestries and stunning stone mosaics that one nun from far-away Persia made . Every inch of the land around the Tower is exquisitely tended to , with gardens that my childhood self could only dream of . The animal pens are clean , the animals themselves are all slick-coated and shining . The art , herbs , simples , perfumes , woolens , tapestries , and fine cheeses made by the nuns keep them living in comfort and style . Compared to the keep where I grew up , the Tower is a palace of luxury . The nuns refused to live in shit like my uncles . <newline> <newline> Neither the blessed relief of being away from my uncle nor the luxurious surrounds of the Tower were the reason I was thrilled ( privately , of course ) to be sent to the Tower . The reason I was thrilled was because I could be educated by the Librarian . <newline> <newline> The Librarian is a dragon . She is the colour of mist , with luminous green eyes matching those of her namesake . She speaks every language known to humans , including many whose last human speaker died before any living human 's grandparents were born . <newline> <newline> Anyway , enough backstory . For everyone 's convenience , especially hers , Foxfire would take a human shape to walk around the Tower . Ergonomics are a thing , and after a thousand years at the Tower , it was just easier . She was in her human form when the army attacked : stocky , of middling height , with pale skin , hair the colour of mist , and luminous green eyes , wearing the same wool robes as all the rest of us . The only obvious mark that she was a dragon was a line of faint silver scales on her brow , a crown of light . <newline> <newline> `` My lady , my lady ! '' <newline> <newline> Sister Clemente shook me awake . `` My lady ! '' <newline> <newline> I groaned and rolled over in bed . `` What 's happening ? '' <newline> <newline> `` The Tower is being attacked , '' she hissed . `` Get up , get dressed , and take shelter . '' <newline> <newline> That shook the fog of sleep off of me . `` Who ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Someone with gold and green banners , '' she said . `` An army , with pikes and horses . Get a move on , I have to wake the others . '' <newline> <newline> I jumped out of bed and started throwing on anything I could get my hands on . <newline> <newline> The Red Tower is wealthy , and this made it a target for thieves . There were numerous defences in place for the casual thief and even bands of roving robbers . Armies , though ? If an army came , though ? The plan was to lock down as much as possible , everyone take shelter , and call for help . Two hundred nuns ranging in age from sixteen to sixty plus were not a match for foot and horse soldiers , and we all know it . <newline> <newline> The stones of the floor were cold beneath my bare feet as I ran for the Library . <newline> <newline> `` Hurry , child , '' called Foxfire . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm coming , '' I panted . <newline> <newline> My job was to roll down fireproof metal doors ( built by a legendary blacksmith nun some hundred years ago ) to keep the books and manuscripts within from burning . Four , five , six , seven doors came down . They were heavy and cold and the old metal tore at my hands . <newline> <newline> `` Now what ? '' I looked around . There was no food and no water in here . And there was no good way to get to the kitchens and get some . <newline> <newline> Foxfire sighed . `` We wait . '' <newline> <newline> We waited and waited . I passed the time by looking up heraldry banners to see who was attacking us . No luck ... whoever it was either was n't in the book , or someone got something wrong . <newline> <newline> Then came the blast . <newline> <newline> I woke up on the Library floor ."

Men and women waltzed around to electronic tones ; swerving , pulsating , mutating bass flooded the room . Lights revealed sides of people that not even they knew , and in a second , it was gone . The room was tilted and spinning , like one of those mazes with the metal ball . *What was in this drink ? * <newline> <newline> I looked deep into the red cup . *Or was it blue ? * I could n't tell in the morphing carousel of movement . I swished it around for a second , to get a better idea of what exactly was in it . Surely this was what was warping my world in such a way . Come to think of it , the bunny-rabbit girl had given it to me . <newline> <newline> She grinned and handed me the drink . <newline> `` What 's in it ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Blood . '' <newline> <newline> `` Blood ? '' <newline> <newline> I took a sip . It clearly was n't blood . <newline> <newline> `` Good one , '' I murmured , looking up for her as she sank into the pulsing crowd of people . <newline> <newline> And now , I was standing here alone . Hand against the wall , as it grew furry and enveloped my hand . The eyes of the partygoers started to glow a fierce green . They all had begun looking at me . Why ? What had I done ? I was just watching . Standing on the wall with my peculiar drink and watching . The music forced me deeper into the wall ; the slurping low tones were gently pushing me forward . The partygoers had all stopped dancing . The churning lights still mutated their faces into grotesque phantasms of themselves . They had stopped moving . Hands at their sides , their ever-changing faces peered at me with dead , green eyes . <newline> <newline> The bass urged me deeper and deeper into the plush walls , as it came over my shoulder . I still held the curious drink in front of me , and as the wall sucked me further back into the embrace of what was concrete a few minutes ago , I felt an unmistakable calm . <newline> <newline> The wall came over my ears and the sleepy roll of the music sunk into me . My arm was still outstretched as to keep the empty faces of the other revelers at bay - `` Look , I 've got a drink . '' It was warm inside the wall , and I let it take me . I took one last sip from the drink , my very last one , and the wall encompassed my head . <newline> <newline> I was nearly part of the wall , drink in my hand when the Bunny Rabbit emerged from the crowd and smashed the bottom of the cup back towards my head . The mysterious concoction slithered down my eyebrows and cheekbones with a sticky slink . Now , as I was becoming part of the scenery , it reminded me of a school dance . All of the kids all lined up by the giant bowl of red juice , waiting their turn to drink . With this thought , I entered the wall with an empty cup and a strange punch to the face ."

Mine . * He pushed back , pushed back until even he outlasted the rat , emerging triumphant with his prize - a patch of dirt-stained concrete . He tucked into himself , wedged his hands beneath his armpits , warmed himself with his own frosty breath . It had been warmer in Arizona . It had been unbearably hot . Suffocating . Even with the way the cold bit his skin , he did n't mind . Beats Arizona . At least he can breathe . <newline> <newline> They had bussed him out of Phoenix with all the others . It was the beginning of his quest . *We do n't want you here . * They did n't make him leave when he got to the next town over . They passed laws instead . No sleeping in public . No sleeping anywhere . *We do n't want you here either . * He counted himself lucky though . His quest continued . He found a train and hopped on the back with nothing more than the tattered bag on his back . Like something out of a book , less real and more like fiction . The wind whipped through his hair and he forgot that he had n't eaten more than half a burger in two days . He was riding a dragon . It breathed smoke and barreled down the American landscape . The dragon took him past state lines . There were n't any buses after that . The cops always took him to the next county over . There 'll be facilities for you there , they said . *Leave us alone .

You can look over the river , and at night , the lights are like stars . The cars like like comets . *You can stay . * They began a routine , him and her .

I had used a single arrow which had been carefully crafted from the Flame Trees in the Firegrave Forest . A single rube had been wielded to the arrow 's tip to give an extra burst of power . It had done its job , as I had done mine . `` Get up , face your Judgement , accept your Fate . '' I said , my black leather boot nudging the man 's leg . <newline> <newline> A groan was released from his lips and he stirred . His grey eyes opened and I saw a series of emotions circulate : confusion , fear , anger and finally understanding .

Everything was over . `` Not many people get to go out on something so thrilling .

It seemed it was Monday and that wasn ’ t okay ! He couldn ’ t stay home and play as he chose , he was needed at work with his big , pointy nose . He grunted and moaned and cried in dismay , did all that he could to push the weekday away . Yet as hard as he tried , despite all that he did , the sun shining outside didn ’ t bat an eyelid . He sighed to himself , now accepting his fate , but cried one last time : who had changed the day ’ s date ? It was Sunday as the night had last come to a close , he was sure of it even as he started to doze . Yet deep down inside he knew not to debate , ignoring his work would be quite the wrong fate . <newline> <newline> Randy put on his favorite blue shorts and his favorite red shirt , then enjoyed a quick breakfast of yummy yogurt ! Although it was Monday , he now felt more alert , and stepped outside with his big smile overt . The sun was still shining and the air was quite warm , Randy ’ s neighbor Charlie was out mowing the lawn . He waved a hello , to which Randy waved back ; perhaps it was time to cut Monday some slack . <newline> <newline> Randy the Rhino walked to the concrete , enjoying the air as he came to the street . He looked both directions , eyes not missing a beat , and then ventured across on his little gray feet . He hopped up the curb and continued his way , passing by friends he saw every day . There was Gina the Gerbil and Larry the Lark , Timmy the Turtle and Sammy the Shark . And oh , who is this ? Who could it be ? It was Mary the Monkey and Billy the Bee He smiled and waved as they passed his way , their faces blank and clearly afraid . They looked so skinny , so scared and alone , an empty bag hanging from Billy ’ s arm bone . Both of them stared with eyes frozen like stone , blood-red and bare like their souls weren ’ t home . Randy laughed gleefully at their silly display and continued walking on his cheerful way . Perhaps Monday wasn ’ t the worst day ! <newline> <newline> Randy the Rhino passed by all sorts of things : From buildings and parks to plain , empty swings . He passed by crowds and houses and zoos , until he came to an alley of strange dangling shoes . They hung on a wire high up in the sky , as if someone had tried to see if they ’ d fly ! He smiled and laughed , how silly they were . Shoes were for feet , not for way above doors ! He fell to the floor and continued laughing , but stopped when he saw four feet come thrashing . They were charging his way , running with purpose ; two blurs that seemed to think life worthless . Randy rolled over to face the commotion , squinting his eyes as he set into motion . Who was that running ? Who could it be ? It was Mary the Monkey and Billy the Bee ! Randy the Rhino smiled with glee—his friends were here to see what he ’ d seen . <newline> <newline> The two kept on running faster and faster , charging straight for him – this could be a disaster ! He tried to stand up , to move far away , but his actions came just a mere second too late . Mary the Monkey and Billy the Bee came crashing down before he could flee . They covered his mouth , and as Randy cowered , he quickly discovered he was quite overpowered ! Billy then turned and presented his stinger , plunging it deep into Randy ’ s poor finger . He screamed as he felt it exit his hand , his bone snapping off as if on command . Mary laughed as he shuttered in pain , then shoved her fist almost into his brain . He screamed out for help , but nobody came , as she repeated the process again and again . He begged her to stop ; he was crying and pleading , every part of him was now badly bleeding . <newline> <newline> Billy the Bee looked down with some pity , then smiled and beat him half into the city . Mary hit next , her fists smashing a ditty , and laughed in his face as his blood became gritty . They giggled and cheered , fists flying like rockets , until Randy ’ s eyes remained still in their sockets . Together they knelt and grabbed at his pockets , digging to see if he even carried a wallet ! He didn ’ t , it seemed , but that was okay : his big , pointy nose would surely save their day . With knives and hatchets they carved quickly away , until what was his now belonged to just they . The two then stood up and went on their way , bag dripping red like a spilled Cabernet . To them it had seemed a rather successful day : For far meth this horn would pay ! <newline> <newline> Randy the Rhino lay still and afraid , the light of the day now withering away .

I screamed in agony before my lungs and through were seared shut , and the blindness overcame me . <newline> <newline> `` Hey buddy '' <newline> <newline> `` BUDDY ! '' <newline> <newline> My eyes slid open and light washed over them . I figure stood above me , an angel ? <newline> <newline> `` Buddy , your gon na have to get off the side walk ! '' the figure fussed . More light began to wash in and my brain started to fit more information into the picture . <newline> <newline> `` What happened ? '' I asked weakly . <newline> <newline> `` Buddy , look . My kids got ta go to school , and i dont want them seeing some druggy in the street , ok '' <newline> <newline> I slowly crawled to my feet and began shuffling away from the upset man . I almost fell before catching myself on a building wall , then promptly spilled my lunch on the sidewalk . <newline> <newline> What happened ? I thought to myself , was that a dream ? Suddenly my cell rang and i pulled out my smart phone . It was silent , it was a different phone . I patted my pockets to find a small flip-phone in the opposite pocket . A Man walks out from behind the alley way and offers to explain it all inside his orientation office . I noticed that he was a little bedraggled , but he had a suit on , and gave me a business card , so i accepted . <newline> <newline> Looking around on the way to my guides office was astounding . Everything looked alien . Sure there were some older things , but the new things were insane ! As we went to his office i noticed a newspaper for sale , headline ; `` Mayor seeks to clean up drug use in the street , and lower taxes in hopes of re-election '' Dated , dated November 5th 2770 . 754 years . 754 years ? What happened to 200 ? did it fail ? <newline> <newline> We stepped into the mans office and he sets me down . The man walked over to the other side of the desks and sat down with a sigh of the weary . A gun came out and we locked eyes . <newline> <newline> `` Look , kid , this is how things are gon na be , i 've locked the doors , so its just you and me , ok ? '' The man rasped <newline> <newline> `` What happened ? I chose 200 years , now i am here , and why do you have a gun ! '' The words poured from my mouth in a mix of panic , confusion , and denial of the situation . <newline> <newline> `` Kid , is n't it obvious , it was a fake , a one way ticket here , to me . Do you think people just leave time devices laying around for the un-enlightened masses to stumble on to ? No , i planted that there , so some fool can blunder his way through time and mess up the entire timeline . '' <newline> <newline> `` it said that ... . '' <newline> <newline> `` it said that the timeline was protected , yea , but its only one device , you can set it down and kill your grandpa . The protected idea is just to get a hit on a pay .

    "target": "Julius gazed into the night sky from the trough of a snowy bank . Thick snowflakes gently danced on their way down , softly blanketing the Earth with a layer of snow . He could see pin-points of light occasionally peer through the clouds polluted with a distant city 's lights . He imagined the people who lived there , those who would worry about work , bills , or even staying warm . But he was warm here , treated to a thick fur coat that was just starting to accumulate with snow . He was unburdened , his stomach full . <newline> <newline> 'Is this just a dream ? ' Julius thought to himself . The answer escaped him , and he settled on the fact that he did n't want to know . <newline> <newline> He went to crawl up the hill , and his legs were blocked by something soft . He looked down . A dribble escaped his mouth and fell onto a leather backpack that was camouflaged with the quickly mounting snow . Embarrassed , he tried licking his lips to stop himself from drooling again . His own lips tasted of heaven . <newline> <newline> He thought , 'Is this backpack mine ? ... No , I do n't remember bringing a backpack here . ' He turned around , and maybe due to the majesty of the tundra ’ s expanse , he felt for a brief moment as though his coat tail might actually be a tail of his own . He scouted behind him for anybody nearby and his eyes fell onto a man lying in the snow ten feet away . The body was n't moving . He was overcome with panic . He quickly approached the man and attempted to speak , but only a whimper found its way out of his throat . <newline> <newline> The man was lying in a pool of dark fluid . Julius lowered his head to sniff , and it smelled familiar . The aroma reminded him of the taste on his lips . Just as he thought this , another dribble escaped from his mouth . At that moment he saw it . The bloody entrails that had been picked apart by a beast . The man 's insides were almost completely eaten . <newline> <newline> Julius went to give out a scream , and all he did was howl . <newline> <newline> Julius soared out of the winter landscape , and woke up in a sweat . It was day time and the heat of the sun was beating down on his face through his window . The humidity was causing the wallpaper to peel away from the walls . The air was thick and stuffy . He turned to the clock , and rubbed his eyes . The window air-conditioner was running , but it did n't feel like it . His shirt stuck to his back . Bed covers were on the floor . <newline> <newline> He took a second glance at the clock through the tiny crust gripping onto his eyelash . '7:00 ' <newline> <newline> `` Seven o'clock ! Crap ! '' He threw himself to his feet . His balance was a bit off , and he fell to all fours . A flash of the dream came rushing back to him . Violently , he shook his head , telling himself it was just a nightmare . He stood again to sprint towards the door . `` Socks ! '' He turned his feet sideways to stop himself , and stumbled as he pivoted backwards . He rushed back and scooped up some socks from the laundry bin . Julius nimbly hopped on one foot towards his shoes while putting the socks on his feet . He jumped into his shoes , wriggled his heel down , and swung the door open . <newline> <newline> The door bounced and an elderly voice shouted , `` Hey , watch it ! '' Julius peeked around the old wooden door into the hall and saw Mrs. Hibbit pulling her little runt of a dog back with a blue leash to prevent it from getting struck . <newline> Julius half-heartedly apologized , as he closed the door . He casually asked , `` How 's the old man ? '' Mrs. Hibbit grunted , and walked right past , sticking her nose up . She boorishly called her Pomeranian as she tugged on his collar . The leash even matched the woman 's over-sized , flowery dress , and purse , and eyes ... it was an eyesore . The dog walked on the opposite side of Julius , tangling his legs in a blue trap . He hopped over the leash , and quickly started for the exit of the apartment again . <newline> <newline> On his way out , Mrs. Hibbit opened her door and Julius could hear the exacerbated coughs of Stephen Hibbit , the woman 's husband , from inside . Steven was the only tenant of his entire building that he could actually tolerate , but recently Julius had n't seen him due to an illness that befell him . He just hoped for the best for Steven . <newline> <newline> Skipping breakfast was not something Julius would usually do , but his boss was not happy with him as it was , so he ran right past the cafe he would normally sit down at , in hopes to still make it to work early . Recently , at work , Julius was dozing off quite a bit . Sure it would get boring sometimes in his cubicle by himself , surrounded with empty chairs up his entire row , but it was entirely uncharacteristic of him . Julius was the last one of his new-hire group who had n't been let go for performance issues , and if he slipped"

It is not even like the careful , tentative fire that we fought on our graduation exam . In the field , Fire is more primal , more raw ... more violent . It pretends to be snuffed , only to bounce back a moment later . In training they told us never to turn our back to Fire . In the field , we learned just how hard it is to follow that maxim . But we fight on . <newline> <newline> We fight on because there is no hiding from Fire , not if we let it grow . We fight on because we are the only wall to protect our families from this inferno .

We fight on , with parched throats and dry eyes , because only after a successful day in the field will we be given our water rations to share with our loved ones .

    "target": "The warm light of Haze ’ s children flickered over her skin and across the craggy walls of the treehome . Her smile , hidden in the near darkness except when one of the children played over her delicate features , was joy mixed with the bittersweet understanding of every parent : that soon the brightest things in her life ( literally , in her case ) would be torn away by time , and that every moment with her children was precious as a glowing hearthcoal in the grip of darkest winter . <newline> <newline> The oldest ball of light , who was named Ripplewater after the pond where she ’ d mated , just the one time , with his father , was already starting to take on material forms . He astonished her with his ability to hold these forms for several standard droplet-falls ( this was a preferred unit of time in their part of the forest ) before he faltered and flickered back into a dancing ball of light . Haze tried to coax him into the human-like form that for eons had been the tradition of her race , but Ripplewater preferred to mimic the sparrow and the titmouse . <newline> <newline> “ Do you want to hear a story ? ” Haze murmured into the darkness , holding out a hand for one of her youngest , Snow , to play across her fingertips . She had grown used to talking aloud like this , talking into the darkness while her children expressed their pleasure or dissatisfaction in movement and modulations of brightness . <newline> <newline> “ About humans ? ” said a little voice , startling her . It was Ripplewater , of course ( Haze was not yet accustomed to hearing and seeing him thus ) . In the light his siblings cast , Haze could see that for now he looked like a tiny human boy , sitting cross-legged upon a ledge of peeling wood . Ah ! The stories were paying off . <newline> <newline> “ Yes , my honeysuckle flower , ” Haze said softly , though her heart beat hard with pride . “ Just one , and then I will sleep. ” Light beams didn ’ t sleep . They would swarm around her in the night , waiting for her to awaken with the rising sun . <newline> <newline> “ Once , ” she began , “ there was a little human larva named Internet . Like all humans , Internet lived in a great big forest made of rocks that were all stacked on top of each other and hollow inside , like enormous stony trees without any branches or leaves. ” It was hard to make sense of such fanciful nonsense , but this was how Haze ’ s mother had described them a long time ago , and Haze had to admit that it *sounded* rather romantic ( until you really thought about it ) . <newline> <newline> “ Internet ’ s forest was called City . And in the middle of City was the biggest stone tree of them all . *So tall* that the pointy thing at the top almost poked a hole in the sky. ” <newline> <newline> “ If it poked a hole in the sky , ” piped Ripplewater , “ would all the stars fall out ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Nobody knows , ” said Haze . She put a finger to her lips and continued . “ So one day Internet decided to climb to the tippy top of the Great Stone Tree . Yes , my little mossflowers , humans have to *climb* because they are *sticky* . They stick to the earth and anything on top of it , like a mouse or a deer or a gecko does . They can not fly like you or I. ” Ripplewater ’ s wide eyes reflected the light of the others , who were almost motionless around him in their attentiveness . <newline> <newline> “ So it was very hard for Internet to reach the top of the Great Stone Tree . For many phases of the moon , he climbed up the inside of the tree . He passed many strange and wonderful things on his journey , like a *plastic* and a herd of mighty *cellphone*. ” The human words were harsh in her mouth , but they savored of faraway lands and exotic human magics , recalling the innocence and wonderment of her own childhood . “ But I ’ ll save the tales of his exploits for another night. ” Sleepiness was getting the better of Haze , and she knew that Ripplewater must be growing tired of maintaining his physical form . It was time to wrap things up . <newline> <newline> “ When Internet got to the top of the stone tree , he stepped out of the *window* and stood on the top to look around . Everything looked so small to him , so far below ! You know what that ’ s like , children , but for Internet it was very surprising . And Internet was so excited that he started to dance . He danced with such wild joy that he forgot to watch where his feet were sticking . And do you know what happened ? ” She waited a moment , but Ripplewater said nothing . “ He danced off the top of the Great Stone Tree and fell all the way back down . If a fairy fell like that—if a fairy could fall—we would simply shatter into little pieces of light . But humans , like sparrows and beetles and foxes , are full of dirt and red water . So when Internet crashed into the earth , he burst open like a rain droplet and all his dirt and water went flying everywhere ! Kabloosh ! ”"

Robin looked to me , then placed his head in the proper position . <newline> <newline> `` One day they will recall this day , '' I said to him , quietly . The crowd waited patiently .

It was the feeling that had stayed with me all these years , like a memory that my skin held onto , the warm kiss of the sun 's rays , and ever since it had craved for more , always there in the back of my mind , a hunger that may never be sated again . Humans need sunlight . That was what I was told . But we do n't always get what we need . And so I 've lived with the thirst for fourteen long years now . <newline> <newline> I have lived underground for all of my life along with the rest of humanity . No one knows why we did . Those are memories long past and forgotten . But we do know a little of the world as it was before the Darkness took over . Few photos and books have survived , but those that did painted a much more vibrant picture of the earth , filled with greenery and light , warmth and a life above ground , animals and seasons and weather , of cities that grew up instead of down . <newline> <newline> I had lost myself in the stories far too many times . I knew them all by heart . There was n't much else to do in the colony otherwise besides working and surviving day by day . There were few kids my age growing up and even still kids are few and far between . Mother told me that people have given up , that our time is coming to an end and we too shall be just a memory . There 's always a sadness to her voice when she tells me this , but I found myself agreeing with those people more and more each year that passes in total darkness . <newline> <newline> The earth was uninhabitable , the land a cold wasteland devoid of life . The colony is the only ting that sustains us , keeps us warm , let 's us carry on with our meager existence . The light within always seemed so dull compared to the sun , but my four year old mind was compromised by my immense imagination . Things always seemed grander back then , full of hope , until reality sets in little by little , year by year . <newline> <newline> Naturally , like my mother and father and almost everyone in the colony , my skin was pale , borderline translucent . Thirsty for the sun . <newline> <newline> The sun . <newline> <newline> It invaded my thoughts almost daily . It was like a sliver of hope for humanity . If the sun came back , maybe , just maybe we could claw our way back from the brink of extinction , live life the way it was supposed to be lived . But there was no hope and mine was dwindling as well . <newline> <newline> I dreamed nightly of green as far as the eye could see , of warmth that soaked down into my bones chasing the chill away . It was hard for me to imagine , the only references I had to go on were old and faded , memories of memories . <newline> <newline> The last time the sun rose it was only briefly , teasing us with a hope that was soon dashed mere hours later as it set once again . The whole colony gathered around the atrium under the great glass dome . Bright orange light had melted the ever present layers of ice and snow enough to stream rays down into the colony . everyone avoided it at first , then slowly , one by one we each took turns stepping into the bright column of light . My eyes stung and I had to squint when it was my turn . I had never felt anything like it before in my short life , but my body seemed to know that this is what it was missing . How could we live without something so essential to who we are as a species ? <newline> <newline> And then it was gone . I wish I had been older when it had happened so I could have fully appreciated it . But my memory would just have to do for now . I still had hope , no matter how small a sliver it was , that I would see it again . Hope that dwindled with each passing year . <newline> <newline> Ten days had passed as usual , but there was something odd . My body grew antsy and I could n't figure out why . The air seemed less biting and there was a different energy about the colony , though no one could explain it . Little did we know that our life was about to change . <newline> <newline> On the eleventh day I awoke to a frenzy that stirred the colony . People rushed to the central atrium . My heart aflutter , I quickly dressed and joined the masses as the gathered around in a circle under the glass dome . <newline> <newline> At first I did n't see it , and then all at once I did and all the memories from the last time washed through me , enveloping me in their fuzzy warmth . At first it was only a speck in the ice above . The room was silent as we all watched , our attention rapt , at the growing yellow-orange dot until , and it seemed like hours had passed , it finally broke through and a sliver of light beamed down onto"

    "target": "I was led to the entrance of the cave where the young couple lived , carved into a hillside near a river . They were two carefree young people—hippie types , perhaps in their early thirties . They were not much older than me , really ! <newline> <newline> The entrance passageway was constructed of natural orange-brown rock , sloping steeply downwards and then breaking into into a set of about 5 steps placed at a ridiculous forward angle . The end of the passageway was solid rock and the actual entrance was on the left . <newline> <newline> I felt myself stumbling slightly on the lose stones that were strewn across the entrance floor , trying to grab onto something to stop myself from falling . `` Would you like us to extend the ladder ? '' She asked cheerfully . `` Ladder ? What on earth is there a ladder for ? '' I thought . The slope of the passageway was steep , sure , but it was still more horizontal than vertical , and a ladder seemed ridiculous ! <newline> <newline> I declined the ladder , but by this stage she had already pressed the button on her remote anyway , and a wooden ladder on a rope pulley slid toward me on my left . As it turned out , it was n't a ladder along the floor of the passageway , but more of a makeshift banister that I could grab on to to steady myself ! Or so it would have been , had I not now reached the top of the treacherous stairs , where annoyingly , the `` ladder ” stopped . I put my arms out like a tight rope walker , and carefully traversed the steep angle of the stone steps , egged on by the hippie couple with so many words of encouragement . They were already down you see ; in fact they 'd been down the entire time ! Apparently , getting into this ridiculous place was second nature to them ! <newline> <newline> By now I was leaning forward and struggling to contain the force of gravity pulling me down . I leaped over the last obstacle and had to slow my running motion from the momentum . The hippie couple clapped and cheered at me in a rather patronizing way – the way you congratulate a child for achieving something for the first time . I was n't impressed . <newline> <newline> They led me into their home through the entrance on the left . Inside was a mixture of dated , unassuming pine furniture , like a dining table with two chairs , some shelves , and then a basic kitchenette with a little breakfast bar carved out of the rock . The kitchenette stopped at a wall on it 's far end , but the wall did n't extended to the other side of the cave , rather leading to another passageway which had what I assumed to be the master bedroom at the end of it . The place had no flooring to speak of , just the dusty ground ; and the walls and ceiling were just the uneven , bare rock with the occasional picture frame , and number of shelves attached to the rock walls . But what the place lacked in terms of carpets or paint , it made up for in the little trinkets that they had presumably took home from their travels all over the world . <newline> <newline> I picked one up off the shelf . It was a blue skull , formed out of some sort of plastic mesh ; so it was not completely solid , even a little fragile looking . The mesh design was uneven and created a series of intricate , repeating patterns that made it look rather beautiful . “ Do you like it ? ” He asked . “ We got it on our trip to Mexico ! They were celebrating a local custom called the day of the dead , where they honor their close friends and relatives who have died ! They were selling these at the market ! ” “ Y-yeah , it 's very cool ! ” I said shyly . “ Tea ? ” she asked . “ Oh.. erm.. Yes please ! ” They both did n't say anything more to me while I explored the room . Despite all this ruggedness , I was starting to feel a cozy sense of home in this place ! <newline> <newline> Now , I should point out that I do n't actually know these people . I 've never met them before today , and I do n't even recall how I became acquainted with them , or why I was invited to their place . The whole thing seemed a little surreal , and the thought that it might be a dream cropped up in my mind ! But dreams are illogical , they do n't follow a coherent story ; they tend to change and morph and jump around . This whole sequence of events , while strange indeed , still followed a logical , linear story . Besides , you can control what people say in your dreams , and I could n't control what they said to me or to each other . Every now and then they would talk to each other in another language , and I could n't influence when they spoke or what they said , with my mind . I could n't influence anything that happened at all , and that 's why I concluded that it could n't possibly be a dream . ( Either that , or I 'm just a really crappy lucid dreamer ! ) <newline> <newline> I turned away from the shelves and found what should really have been the elephant in the room all this time . In"

And Mr. Cook and Dr. Goodman are opposed on economic reasons. ” <newline> <newline> “ Please Doctor . You sell our reasoning short , ” Mr. Cook responded . “ This decision could and would eliminate 450 million jobs globally . No more sin means no more crime which means no more police . No more security guards . No more crime means no more knife and gun wounds so hospitals become ghost towns . No more crime means no more lawyers and judges . These skills are not transferable .

We here represent ALL of humanity. ” Mr. Leonard stormed out of the conference room and his last shout echoed through the corridor , “ Look at the greater good you closed minded fools ! ” Dr. Lee visibly shuttered in her seat . The only noise now was Dr. Whalen sipping on his coffee . <newline> <newline> Silence , like this , is one of the hardest things in the world to describe because one is , in effect , describing nothing . This quiet wasn ’ t awkward since no one felt compelled to fill it out of some social necessity .

    "target": "It had been an eternity since we got a horde of zombies attacking our camps . At this point in the apocalypse , we knew that there probably were n't many survivors left . Something they never told you in the movies was that zombies can go extinct too . It takes a lot longer , but they do . Apparently plants or animal meat was n't enough to keep zombies going , because after a few months without fresh zombie meat , they start eating each other until there 's only one of them left and ca n't eat anything else anymore . We found out by experimenting with zombies . We had to find out more about them to try to find a cure , but after 25 years of undead chaos , we did n't really care anymore . We did n't find a cure and we had gathered a small group of survivors to at least try to get human kind back on track and not make the same mistake . The order was easy this time : 'Shoot them all till there 's no undead left ' . The amount of people we lost due to trying to catch enough for the cure and experimenting with them was too big . It was time to create a safe place for everyone . <newline> <newline> My daughter put on her coat . 'I 'm coming with you . ' <newline> Her face was resolute , but my opinion was more resolute than that . 'Oh no , you 're absolutely not coming with anyone . You stay put . ' I knew the look she gave me , but I did n't care . <newline> 'We only have 250 people in this colony , 150 who can actually go out and fight . There are around 200 zombies . Do you really not want the extra help ? It could save lives ! ' <newline> 'It could also cost your life ! You are only 17 , you do n't even remember what a zombie looks like . You are staying here Holly , no more discussion ! ' <newline> <newline> It was difficult raising Holly on my own . Her mother , Heather , the love of my life , killed by a zombie while searching for that stupid cure that probably did n't even exist . As soon as people turn , they are nothing more than a piece of rotten flesh whose only thought is getting brains . Heather 's brain . A tear left my eye . 'You okay there Joe ? ' Fred had a concerned look on his face . 'We 're about to kick some zombie ass , we all need to concentrate and not turn into a rotten piece of flesh . ' Fred had been my first ally , back when it all started . He was the one who got him through the time after Heather died . His wife Mona and him had taken him and Holly , who was 5 at the time , into their home . They treated Holly like their 3rd child , which really helped her deal with the loss of her mother , something nobody should ever even have to deal with till they 're old . We lived in a cruel world though . <newline> <newline> The horde hit the outer barrier we set up . Some of them died due to the electric fence , but the next few climbed over their zombie friends to get over it . There were still at least 200 of them last . Our snipers took out a few more . They had to get closer for us to kill them with our assault rifles . Another one of my mates died on a scavenger hunt on one of these things . He found the rifle in an empty house , but then found out it was n't empty . The guy the rifle belonged too stabbed my friend in the back , without even trying to ask any questions . The rest of the crew immediately shot the guy , but my friend lost too much blood . We do n't need people who make rush decisions , we want some reasoning . A few zombies made it close enough . Every zombie I hit reminded me of my friend . His death would not be forgotten , not on my watch . <newline> <newline> Only a couple of zombies were left , smart enough to hide . Meant they were still pretty fresh . Seems like a few people tried to reach the camp and brough some infected with them . People were too attached to their friends to make the logical decision . They 'd rather turn into zombies together , only to forget about them only hours after they get infected too by that same loved one . <newline> <newline> It was my turn to go out there with a squad to get rid of the last ones . We did n't want some infected with some reason in their head to find a way into our camp when we were n't watching . My crew members were 5 males and 3 females . I did n't really waste any time to chitchat . I noticed Fred was one of them and just walked beside him . 'They say 2 of them are in that house over there and 3 are just over the ledge on our right . I say we split up and send 5 to the ledge and 4 to the house so we have a 2 person advantage . You guys know the drill , keep an eye on every one of your crew member and hit 'em in the head .

In the daylight I am Whiskers , friend to the humans who live in this house , but at night I am Shadowswipe and I fight to defend our land . <newline> <newline> As night falls I am called to the borders of my land where I meet Razorpounce and Deathclaw , my brothers in my nightly duties . These two warriors have been my brothers for many a year , Deathclaw living next door since long before I was born and Razorpounce a new addition at number 32 when I was still but a trainee under Deathclaw myself . <newline> <newline> Together this small band defends the homelands against interlopers , the ones who would pull our lives to the ground and shit on them like cheap kitty litter . Together we are the Brotherhood . <newline> <newline> That night our patrol had begun as it always did . We sat on the fence at number 16 and looked out over the great dark road . Across was the Deadlands , an area where no cat could go , as it was infested with that most vile vermin , dogs . The Deadlands are not our great fear though , the dogs are slaves to the humans and humans are too stupid to invade other territory . No the Deadlands is almost a boon , a rock to brace our back against when all around the world attacks and to say *no more , this is as far as we shall be pushed* . <newline> <newline> The evening was quiet , peaceful , silent . Lights from houses flickered on and off and we moved along the western edge , keeping a look out , but seeing and hearing nothing . As we passed into the sacred woods we made the sign of the beast , three scratches in the earth , to show humility and honour to our dead . <newline> <newline> Tonight Deathclaw halted us not far into the woods , he was hungry and so we spaced out and soon had each taken down a mouse or shrew and sat happily chewing our way through them . Finishing we moved on , towards the centre of the woods where the edge of our territory lay and we would mark the demarcation , to ward off anyone who would pass near and be unaware this that was our land . Soon we were on the way back to the houses , the woods clear and the rodents cowed for another day . <newline> <newline> Passing back into the gardens we felt it immediately , something had changed . A scent lingered on the air and the noise was different . The *feel* in our whiskers was different . Deathclaw did n't need to say anything but Razorpounce and I moved off quickly , he taking the Northern Fence and I moved up onto the bungalow guttering , each of us straining our senses to find what it was that had changed . <newline> <newline> Deathclaw took the dangerous path , as he always did . He walked through the middle of the gardens , fur fluffed , but passing confidently past hedge and bush , daring whatever it was to come at him . We reached number 41 before we felt it again , whatever it was had drawn close and a sudden chill had come across the gardens . Even the faint noises of bats had gone from the distance , it was deathly silent . <newline> <newline> Deathclaw stopped , sniffed the air and then leapt onto the birdbath , allowing him some height against whatever was in the dark . When it came forward we all saw and smelled it at the same time , how it concealed itself before I have no idea but suddenly it was overwhelming and all consuming . <newline> <newline> It was the largest fox I have ever seen in my life and had strolled into the garden and now sat , beneath the birdbath , staring up at Deathclaw . Deathclaw was not a small cat , in fact he was one of the largest and strongest I have ever known , but this fox was vast . It was the size of a Doberman and had scars criss-crossing his face showing he was no stranger to fighting . <newline> <newline> Casually he stood and then lifted a leg and pissed in the grass and the scent of `` MINE '' filled the air . Deathclaw was a tactician , a careful fighter , but this deliberate insult was too much and with a yowl he was in the air , claws extended and swiping across the foxes face , before he could even finish the piss . <newline> <newline> The fox was taken aback , used , I suppose , to fighting on his own terms , but this did not last long . He snapped out at Deathclaw and missed him by a hair and then snapped again at his tail . Deathclaw was not so foolish to be taken like that , we had all fought foxes over the years but never one like this , never such a beast . <newline> <newline> I moved down , getting closer as quietly as I could . On the other side I could see Razorpounce waiting too and we held each other in our gaze to time this to perfection ; through long training and fighting together , we knew what we would do against this threat . Deathclaw had moved back , pulling the fox forward , but it was insanely quick and snapped out and caught Deathclaw by the ear , pulling him forward for a second and then blood glistened in the dark , as his ear was tattered ."

An old beater , with a sliding keyboard . Tyler is carved crudely , on the back . He did that himself , with a screwdriver . I believe he was about , eleven at the time . He 's had this thing , for a very long time . I look around , no one is paying attention to me . I lean in close to his ear . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , '' I whisper . `` I miss you .

I put it to the side , of my head . Looking at the haggard person in the mirror . I know I should be terrified . I can feel my heart racing , but I do n't feel afraid . I pull the trigger **click** . I snap open the gun , and add two more bullets . More than half . I spin again . This time , I put it , in my mouth . **click** My heart is pounding now . I throw the gun in frustration . <newline> <newline> I flop onto his bed . The smell of his cologne surrounds me . I start crying again . I pull out my phone .

Opening it up my heart stops . *I miss u 2* <newline> <newline> I am going to kill the little dipshit , that stole Tyler 's phone . I grab the gun , and storm out to the car .

Using my phone , as a flashlight . I check the empty doorway . If someone was fucking with me . they were , in that room . <newline> <newline> I pull out the gun , and leap in . Shining my flashlight everywhere . There is no one , just Tyler laying in his casket . A small glow is coming from his suit pocket , from the missed call . Pocketing the revolver , I find a light switch . It was slightly less spooky , but only just.. I walk up to Tyler , and pull out his phone"

I was still unsure if the commanding officer actually had issued the order , and jumped a little when the thunderous boom of the sergeant ’ s voice came from a few feet behind him , shouting at the commanding officer . I recognized the puzzled and horrified facial expressions of my fellow soldiers and realized I must have had just the same expression showing on my own face . Wailing started to emerge when one of the villagers had translated the command to the rest of the inhabitants . « I said open fire on the villagers , is that understood ? » The commanding officer shouted , repeating his command . A collective , but hesitant « Yes sir » could be heard across the town square and soldiers started to take aim.One platoon began herding people together , shooting those who didn ’ t comply and those who did . Gunfire was getting louder and more frequent . The sergeant who had been standing close to me had gone over to the commander and was shouting at him to stop this madness . The commander not seeming to care , unholstered his pistol and without flinching he cocked the gun and blew out the brains of the sergeant . The message was clear , do as he said or end up like the sergeant . I took my gun of my back and hoisted it so I could aim . In my hands I had a death-bringer , a life-releaver , an automatic delivery system of death and misery . I forced myself to become a machine , an insensitive war-machine who fulfilled the commanding officer ’ s perverted desire for violence . I walked over to the group of people now standing in a long line against the wall . I took aim and started firing . *Click , click , click* , the sound of the mechanics in the gun was the only thing I heard . A grey concrete I was painting red was the only thing I could see . Pain , sorrow , anger , sadness the only emotions I felt . I hated myself for not being brave enough to confront the Commander like the sergeant had , but I was a coward . The wall behind the victims , the so-called enemies who threatened the western world ’ s existence by existing , was now chipped and red . Screaming , crying and horrific noises weren ’ t coming from the inhabitants of the village , but from the soldiers pulling the triggers . I snapped out of my trance-like state when my gun stopped firing . No more ammo , and no more people . I sat down , let my tears blend with those of the villagers , cursing the Commander , the western society , and god himself . Not noticing i was on my back , the grey sky above blurred because of the tears in my eyes and I closed them . I laid there for a long time , sobbing , loathing , crying before i fell asleep ."

'' <newline> <newline> I shook my head as my eyes grew accustomed to the light . I was n't sure where exactly I was , or how I got here , but I did remember dying . Or at least , it felt like death . You know , I had my whole family there . I was old , living out my final days in the comfort of my childhood home . My kids were there , and so were their kids , and even a few of my great-grandchildren . I had lived a good life . <newline> <newline> `` He 's reliving his last moments , '' a second voice said . It was feminine , unlike the first . <newline> <newline> `` That 's normal . Open the pod .

She stood tall , posture was perfect , and her hair looked just like my daughters . Wanda .

I nodded . <newline> <newline> `` How was Heaven ? '' <newline> <newline> I almost laughed at God 's comment , that was n't his *actual* name , that 's just what everyone called him around here . He was the Creator and the Savior , and just about everything in between . <newline> <newline> `` Better , '' I finally managed to croak out , my voice was coarse .

'' <newline> <newline> I agreed . `` I can do better . Next time I go in .

Unfortunately , your path as a Doctor and not a Politician as we agreed did n't help much . '' <newline> <newline> `` I had limited options with the background you gave me . '' <newline> <newline> God waved his hands , `` All part of the test , which you did pass by the way . '' <newline> <newline> I reached for the towel Wanda was now handing me . One of the downsides to our home was the cold , and the fact that you had to be naked going in the pod . I cleaned myself off before stepping out and heading towards my locker . <newline> <newline> `` How 'd the others do ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Seven were successful , including you , '' Wanda said . She was reading from her clipboard , I knew that . `` Thirteen failed . Three critical . One death .

I have one KIA , three in critical , and nine fails . I want some answers . '' <newline> <newline> Wanda shook her head , `` Unfortunately , we do n't have many . We attributed some of the pitfalls to the aspects of humanity of the time . Others to random factors . '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's it ? '' I petitioned , `` *Random* factors ? '' <newline> <newline> God took my shoulder , `` Yes . In the end , a world with free will , '' he sighed , `` it will always have chaos . The necessity of man , to say the least .

But where the warcaster was it was pleasantly quiet , or at least as quiet as the front lines of any active battlefield could be . No Assault Kommado 's gas grenade landing at his feet , no Widowmaker a hundred yards away with their lethal crosshairs on him , and no damn Khadoran warjack coming his way . Creator help him , it was the best he had it in weeks . <newline> <newline> If it was n't for the damn iron rations . <newline> <newline> A can of bully beef , the canned meat loomed unappetizingly on his mess kit . Besides it was what the can swore was vegetable stew . Pike personally never saw the similarities ; brown and salty did not a stew make . If he 'd been served this in any tavern at Point Bourne , the Captain likely would 've dunked the cook in his own poison . But alas , in battle one was far less particular about their fare , and counted every meal as a blessing . <newline> <newline> `` Pass me some of that sheet iron , Capt , will you ? '' The Trencher Sergeant across from Pike said . <newline> <newline> The veteran soldier had a similar stomach churning meal in front of him , his Model 4 Spoon flashing as he shoveled the apparently edible food into his mouth .

Could lose a tooth otherwise ... or my lunch . '' <newline> <newline> `` Thinking 'bout those fancy meals you had growing up ? '' <newline> <newline> Pike laughed , the only merry thing for miles in this hellish land of rusted barbed wire and unburied corpses . <newline> <newline> `` Hardly . My family were freeholders in the Watcher Peaks . We had it better than most but it was still a hard living , Menoth grant it . But it was honest . That said ... I 've had my share of wining and dining . Truth be told , I dislike most of it . '' <newline> <newline> `` Pretend you do thought , Sir , and I 'll live vicariously through you . '' <newline> <newline> Captain Aeron Pike smiled , taking a sip of his overboiled tea . <newline> <newline> `` Let 's see ... there was the time I was invited to dine at Fort Whiterock . Duke Mordin was pleased to hear that a warcaster had discovered within his Duchy and sent an invitation to Point Bourne while I was still a lieutenant at the academy . Me , this twenty year old Corporal turned officer invited by one of the most powerful men in the kingdom . Anyways , they sent a carriage to pick me up after I got three weeks leave and took me to Fort Whiterock . Now , its not any Ceryl to be sure but still . It 's impressive . The had this dish that I ca n't for the life of me remember its name . But it was apparently some Caspian fare . Roasted goose stuffed with spices from the lands of Zu , covered in some light chile glaze of sorts . Apparently it was a joke of sorts to give the hottest piece to the youngest person there : me . It took me two cups of ale before my tongue stopped burning . After that , they had those little sweet cakes with that really hard icing on it , fondant or whatever its called . Truth be told , it was rather bad ; too sweet for my taste . But the girl I was with , the Baron of Rosaleen 's daughter she liked it . Being young and impressionable , I naturally agreed with her like a fool . Still , it was worth it . '' <newline> <newline> `` Begging your pardon , Captain , but I heard Khadorans make their fare sound better .

Thanks for that. ” I wiped hot tears from my face , as I realized that ending my life had done nothing to curb all the hatred that I had felt in my heart . I was furious , and the man responsible for all my suffering was standing before me . “ You have got some kind of sick sense of humor , you know that , you son of a bitch ? ” <newline> <newline> I began to ransack the room frantically , looking for anything heavy to throw at the manifestation of all my anger . “ Here , let me help you , ” he said gently , holding out my revolver . <newline> <newline> I wrenched the weapon from his hand , pointing it straight at his chest with a shaking hand .

How the hell is anyone supposed to make one place that satisfies everyone 's desires ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I tried ...

The hall went silent , all eyes slowly turned to me , just a small wimpering boy who 'd jokingly prayed to Odin after being run over by a car . <newline> <newline> `` Uh ... hi ... I 'm Martin , '' I said with my hands tucked behind my back . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , uh , hi Martin . Jeez another meek creature , come here , '' Ted waved his hand for me to approach . He was n't a very frightening man- he was skinny like me and just a few inches taller . Everyone else in the dining hall was stuffed with muscle that bordered on anatomical incorrectness . <newline> <newline> Martin walked over , flinching as each warrior tore into their turkey legs . `` So Martin , you worshipped the old norse gods while you were alive ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No I just ... jokingly prayed to him when I went for the ball and- splat ! '' Martin clapped his two hands together for the sound effect . <newline> <newline> `` I had a similar route here . So , there 's something you and I share , do you know what that is ? '' Martin shook his head . <newline> <newline> `` Knowledge . These fools no nothing , they 're all Jon Snows , and here we are kings in a world that 's never seen a true crown . You know how I got this position ? I poisoned someone , with the easiest mix of plants ever . I studied , I read a book and right in there it had a recipe of how to kill a God . Luckily , the same wo n't work for me , I 'm no god , I 'm better , I 'm a man . '' <newline> <newline> `` How 'd you poison the all father ? '' Martin asked , he kept his posture strong and his voice as clear as possible . Now was not the time to look weak . <newline> <newline> `` Like I said , some plants around here make a damn good poison , '' Ted shirked him off , returning to the turkey leg in front of him . As the last of the meat juice dribbled down his face he waved a few scantly clad women over . They clawed at him , demanding his physical attention , but the demented man just smiled- what more could a man want ? <newline> <newline> Martin found a spot at the back of the dining hall , squished between two vikings that had never made it into the tales as more than victims . If this Ted fool could rise up to be king , maybe Martin could too . He broke open the bone of his turkey leg , holding one sharp end in each hand and eyes the pulsating neck of the viking to his left . <newline> <newline> Martin stabbed , shoving the bone into the jugular vein and tearing it downward . The other viking seated on Martin 's left drew his axe but not before Martin stabbed him in the kidney and moved to strike his jugular . This might be easier than he thought . <newline> <newline> As the second viking fell , Martin heard the cool rush of iron through the wind behind him . That was it , he 'd already lost . The axe severed Martin 's head from his shoulders as it bounded across the floor . He should 've fought them like Ted did , in the shadows ."

It could no longer spin up the projectiles , but it could still pack the punch behind them . No longer capable of fully automatic fire , it became a hand held artillery gun . Seeing the smoke , his commanding officer yanked the gun from Tucker 's hands and shook his head . <newline> <newline> `` Rookies . '' <newline> <newline> Tucker joined the army because it was the only profitable thing that was left to do . In training , he got a few choice nicknames for his ability to seize up his weapons .

He 'd look up the sky and shake his head , the clomping of the instructor 's boots always meant a chewing out . <newline> <newline> `` Damn it , son ! How many is that this week ? Rampart Corp has been in existence for near three hundred years and you 're single-handedly bankrupting the entire outfit ! '' The instructor tore the gun out of Tucker 's hands . <newline> <newline> Tucker chose the Rampart Corporation because the qualifications were the most widespread . He did n't do well in the other other of the hundred jobs he 'd applied for . The things he did manage to do were menial , which meant enough for only him in his life . Tucker needed a little more , there was someone new in his life . He tried , he really did , but he failed out of everything else . Rampart Corporation for his last choice because it was so controversial . <newline> <newline> The shiny office buildings were only the tip of the iceberg . It was a company in charge of requisitions on a planet wide scale . Invasion forces were dispatched once a year to some outer arc planet who did n't want to join the federation . All the other times , Rampart would be scooping up systems rich in various resources . The armada at the hands of Rampart was impressive , that 's what happened when war became a viable business . <newline> <newline> The invasion force Tucker was assigned to had their own slogan , the jingles in the commercials were pretty catchy , `` Pick a star on the dark horizon '' . The battle cry went up when it came time for requisitions . Every species had the choice , they were wined and dine first , the join the federation . In all honesty , the benefits of joining were vast , science and technology on those outer arc planets were always slow to evolve . Some of them were a little hesitant , that meant invasion . <newline> <newline> During the drop , Tucker could hear thousands of voices singing their jingle . There was really no going back at that point . He was part of the problem now , might as well make some money . He started to sing . <newline> <newline> The initial landing went well , the scouts made their way inland setting up operation bases . The company had a policy that the newest recruits , like Tucker , would be sent in to scare unarmed civilians . Take as few lives as possible in the time-frame set by the bean counters . <newline> <newline> Tucker 's commanding officer called him a rookie and pushed him behind a wall . The racket of fifteen other guns cycling and blasting an empty building to pieces was drowning out the CO 's voice . An explosion shook the ground , Tucker tried to lean forward to see what was happening , a hard rap on top of his helmet caught his attention . <newline> <newline> The CO was pointing at the settings . Cycle , fully auto , a little red light blinked meaning that it was out of action . He help up his finger and spun it in a circle , his mouth moving , but Tucker could n't hear a thing . The CO pressed the level to the next setting , semi-auto . The CO held up one finger , then he pointed down a street at the side of an office building . He pointed the gun and pulled the trigger . A wisp of smoke trailed down the street and when it hit the wall , an neat hole the size of a fist was left in the concrete . <newline> <newline> The CO dragged Tucker by the collar and pushed him down to one knee . The noise was still overwhelming the CO so he reverted to trying handsignals . Tucker had to cover their backs , keep an eye out for any moment behind them . He knelt , keeping the gun trained on , eyes swept left to right , nothing . It was n't long before he lost focus , he was taking in sights rather than covering anyone . He was sitting on his feet with his gun across his knees when he felt a smack on the top of his helmet . When he turned to look , his squad must have moved a block down . A sheepish grin crossed his face when he thought of sitting in the middle of a street with no one around . His CO dragged him to his feet . <newline> *** <newline> * [ I swear , it 's inevitable that folks 'round these parts will walk in when I 'm clacking away at this thing ... other than a writing exercise , I guess it 's something else I should learn to pick up ,"

For no matter what she had seen , and she had seen all kinds of things , she always had a smile on her face . In fact , I ’ ve always wondered if she was a bit of a psychopath . She could even smile as death and destruction would rain down on a crowd of people . But only a broken smile hung off of her face now . The immortal , the woman I fell in love with , was human after all . <newline> <newline> “ You really want to know what the afterlife is like ? ” she asked me . “ I… I don ’ t know . I ’ ve heard many tall tales of the afterlife , but I ’ ve never believed any of them .

Well first , I thought you ’ d like to know . And second , kissing an immortal apparently changes things when you die . I don ’ t have those negative effects that other ghosts get . And so I ’ ve stayed a ghost , following my beloved around . She doesn ’ t know I ’ m there and she never will . But for all of my life , ever since I could remember , she had been there for me and taken care of me . And now I would be there for her to the end of all times .

Slowly James began walking to the edge of the canyon , each step became more and more treacherous , he had not become accustomed to the difference in gravity yet . Scuttling to the edge , he reconfirmed what he saw on the opposite side , holes . Not just any holes either , ones that had been carved into arches leading deep into the wall . These were not natural either as the arches were too perfect and he noted small carvings on them . As James began thinking how they got there , and more importantly , what put them there he began to feel a presence behind him . It took him a few seconds to fully grasp the idea that something was truly behind him , but when he did , a natural reaction occurred and he quickly turned around . What he found in front of him was a large figure towering above him , face covered by shadow and two silhouettes coming from its back . Time slowed down for what felt like minutes while James was taking in what he saw , but only seconds had passed .

I 've seen things no man should witness , my parents fell before my eyes , families around me were forced to succumb to the violence , or die fighting it . I was abandoned by those who once helped me , confused to where I had come from , who I was , or what my purpose was anymore . I 've been told what was once my house is now in The Forbidden Zone . Those who dare enter , stay . Awake for days on end , I question what 's left , if anything , of what I once called home . Forced out in the days I cease to remember , I ventured to the walls many times . Thick , crude walls of wood rising high above me , blood of my brethren stained the barrier that kept my curiosity so strong . <newline> <newline> `` I can enter , but will I leave ? '' I question myself . <newline> <newline> Curiosity , overwhelming me , has brought me on edge . The cruel and psychological torture of unfamiliarity of myself has broken through the rational barriers of my mind , invading me . I dared to venture once again to the walls . Those left homeless and without shelter were allowed in , shaking in terror as they approached , not knowing what horrors could be awaiting them . The oak doors lay open , splintered and engraved with fingernail carvings from those who could not escape . One deep breath , and I pushed myself forwards . <newline> <newline> The doors moved closer with every step , and soon , they were behind me . I choked as my eyes took in what laid before me . Ruins of neighborhoods , children 's bodies littering the streets , and homeless men painfully moving between houses to with armfuls of wreckage . Nothing laid intact . Tears filled my eyes , falling from my cheeks and onto the charred concrete beneath me . <newline> <newline> `` Is this really what humans have become ? Leaving destruction and broken lives within our wake ? Taking , and taking , never giving back to what keeps us breathing ? Have we all become mad ? Have I ? '' <newline> <newline> I continued my journey , legs weak with sorrow for those forced to take , not knowing whether they 'll be alive in but six hours . Streets were empty , living only to give what little they still had . Memories torn from the lives of those who once called this city home , lay tattered upon the streets . <newline> <newline> I came upon a house , smaller than the rest . The only house that seemed to still stand within the walls . The red bricks that held the house up were as broken as I felt , the roof drooped heavily where the water had eroded its way in , and the picket fence that once stood , torn apart by those in need of materials . A cold breeze swept past me as I smiled . This is home . <newline> <newline> I took slow steps towards the opening , taking in every moment . Each step took more effort than the last , though I could not stop myself from moving . I stepped through the door , my heart clatter upon the floor loudly as I saw everything had been stripped from the house . From my memory . From me . One single object stood out among the wreckage , untouched by time and destruction . A picture frame . Behind the glass , was me . Water had seeped into the wooden frame , blurring my family around me , leaving only me in the center . I 'm all that 's left of us , immortalized only by a single piece of paper stained with ink . Within these wooden borders , is home ."

They were in his room , again . <newline> `` I told you you can not be here when I 'm home '' , said to the empty room . <newline> <newline> Even being a relatively new deceased , Jasper followed his instincts and hide , although not as efficiently as the more experienced spectral comrades of the group . He chose to stand behind Dr. Harrison 's closet door , where Dr. Harrison found him rather quickly . <newline> <newline> `` I understand you 're new , but this is unacceptable . Go away , make yourself invisible and mind your own business . I got to sleep . '' said angrily Dr. Harrison . <newline> <newline> `` Mr. Harrison , I ...

Eventually you start loving the 'job ' , and loving the man you scare as if he was your family '' said the fat ghost with a smile in the face . <newline> <newline> `` I guess you had a long day with everything related to dying . It 's a mess , am I right ? You should rest , and we 'll talk tomorrow morning . Sleep well '' said while starting to fade . <newline> <newline> `` Wait ! '' said Jasper . <newline> <newline> `` Yes"

'' <newline> <newline> As the Commander accepted the papers from his colleague , he took one last look out of his office window at the screaming populace below . As much as he enjoyed watching the people go about their daily lives , they were much more enjoyable to watch before they were on fire . Several times in the past , he had successfully defended and protected these people from various adversities , and had received numerous commendation for doing so . This time would prove to be the exception and , predictably , would also be his last . <newline> <newline> `` Martha , '' noted the Commander as he perused through the pages . `` I 'm looking over these charts , and I 'm afraid I do n't see where the problem is . The orbital atmospheric scrubbers appear to be working perfectly as intended . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , sir , that 's just the problem . When the scrubbers were launched they were intended to mitigate climate change by converting greenhouse gasses into oxygen . Today , they still perform this job with the utmost efficiency . '' <newline> <newline> Martha paused to compose herself before continuing . `` Unfortunately , the R & D team failed to properly factor in the human response to this project . '' <newline> <newline> `` What exactly do you mean , Martha ? '' the Commander asked , the fear and annoyance in his tone becoming more prominent . `` How could 'human response ' cause such a disaster of unparalleled scale ? ! '' <newline> <newline> Martha attempted to explain as best she could , given her circumstances : `` Even though the scrubbers greatly reduced global temperature increases caused by climate change , heavy industries saw this as an excuse to increase their production , and thus their pollution , rather than working on ways to reduce the pollution their industries cause . This year , greenhouse gas emission levels were even higher than they were when the scrubbers were launched . The gasses are being converted by the scrubbers , and ironically , this means that oxygen levels in our atmosphere are now dangerously high . '' <newline> <newline> Taking note of the sight outside the Commander ’ s window , she ended her exposition with a slight quip : `` I think by now you 've probably figured out how flammable pure oxygen is . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not interested in your jokes , Martha , I 'm interested in knowing if there 's any way we can stop this ! '' the Commander bluntly insisted . <newline> <newline> `` The scrubbers are positioned over several key population centers in geosynchronous orbit , and each one is powered by a self-sustaining onboard nuclear reactor designed to last at least a century . Even if we could somehow launch a rocket into orbit with enough people knowledgeable enough to disconnect the power source , they 'd still have to do it at least 49 more times before oxygen levels drop below 'Oh , the humanity ! ' amounts . Furthermore , by the R & D team ’ s calculations , the scrubbers would need to be deactivated within about… 10 minutes or so. ” <newline> <newline> After Martha finished , the Commander ’ s look went from anxious trepidation to a kind of sobering tranquility . He finally understood the reason for Martha ’ s humor . Speaking softly , the Commander asked : “ I suppose it would be a stretch to ask the R & D department to rerun the numbers ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Normally I would honor your request , sir . However , based on my knowledge of the protection the R & D facilities have , the rest of the team have probably been reduced to pure carbon by now. ” <newline> <newline> The Commander chuckled slightly at Martha ’ s last statement as he glanced out his window at the scenery unfolding around them . There was an odd , nihilistic sense of beauty to the cataclysm his people had wrought that was now consuming everything they had ever achieved . For the first and last time of his life , he was truly at peace . <newline> <newline> “ Martha , I have one last request for you , if you would be so kind as to honor it. ” <newline> <newline> “ What is it , sir ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Please go down to my quarters and retrieve my music player . There ’ s a song by The Ink Spots that would be perfect for this moment . ”"

If I didn ’ t move , did somebody else move me ? That is impossible . <newline> <newline> I Am Alone . But am I happy ? <newline> <newline> Falling . I was still falling .

I reached out , falling faster . I grabbed on to Her hands , and then She was falling with me . I glanced at Her and She was looking at me . She laughed , and it made Her throw Her head back , and Her golden hair , bounced in the wind I felt from us falling . Falling . Falling in love . <newline> <newline> I am no longer alone , and I am happy . <newline>"

    "target": "Word to wise , this is my first prompt . I 'm working on improving my writing skill . <newline> <newline> The Pope wrung his hands uncomfortably the entire flight . Mere weeks ago , Earth had received an off world transmission , the first in decades . It had been relayed immediately to the UN , and was then passed on to the Vatican . Apparently some alien race was prepping to land in Washington , DC , and required Earth 's “ top religious leader. ” The transmitters had insisted they would be landing unarmed , but many , the United States especially , were on edge . <newline> Pope Francis glanced out the window , noticing the jut of land that had to be the East Coast of the US . A few turbulent minutes later , and the jet was setting down on a private airstrip outside the Pentagon . As the Pope stepped off , he was immediately rushed by waves of all manner of people ; news reporters , government officials , Christians . His body guards cleared the path towards the Pentagon . <newline> “ Welcome , Your Holiness , ” the President started , holding out his hand . “ It very good of you to come with a matter like this. ” <newline> “ I feel it to be my obligation , ” he replied slowly . “ Do we know when they are to arrive ? ” he asked , with a cursory glance upward . <newline> “ We received confirmation moments ago that the craft is beginning its decent . They should be here shortly. ” <newline> <newline> Sure enough , half an hour later , the aforementioned alien craft was setting down in the designated landing pad . To call it enormous was an understatement . The top half was black , and towered above the Pentagon building and in turn the crowds . The lower half was surprisingly a light teal colour , and from this opened a large set of doors . The creature that stepped out was awe inspiring . <newline> It stood several heads taller than any human awaiting it . It had a bulging , metal plated chest and arms , and no legs to be seen . Its head was a pale cloud of gas , swirling about inside a glass casing . It hovered down the ramp , and towards the podium where the President and Pope stood . <newline> “ Welcome to our planet , and our country , ” the President said emphatically . <newline> The extraterrestrial paused , and pressed a few buttons on its arm module . “ I AM QUITE GRACIOUS FOR THE HOSPITALITY , ” it boomed . The sound came to emanate from everywhere at once . Everyone jumped at the noise , including the alien . Holding up a finger , he turned again to the arm module and pressed buttons rapidly . <newline> “ My apologies , ” it continued . The voice was now at a much quieter tone . “ I do n't often use my projection software , and must admit am a bit rusty with it. ” <newline> “ Anyway , ” he said . “ As was laid out in our transmission , I am here to obtain your religious leader. ” <newline> The Pope paled at this . “ Why am I needed to go with you ? ” He demanded ? <newline> The alien chuckled at this . “ Well , we put you on this planet for experience . We did this with many beings , across all species of the galaxy. ” <newline> “ Although ... it seems the immortality gene seems to have faltered . Interesting , it did n't do that with the others ... ” <newline> “ What are you talking about ! ? ” The Pope fumed , growing quite red in the face . “ What 'immortality gene ' ? ” <newline> The alien was taken aback . “ When we sent you here , 2000 years ago . We knew it would be much longer than a human 's lifespan before we returned , so we fitted you with an anti-aging gene so you could gather experience without ... dying. ” <newline> The anger faded from the Popes eyes , to be replaced with a look of confusion . “ 2000 ? 2000 ? ? I am not even 80 ! ” <newline> “ What ? Are you not the ... ” The alien glanced at his arm again , “ Jesus Christ we delivered ? ” <newline> “ No . I am Pope Francis. ” <newline> “ Hmm , ” he glanced around at the people surrounding the podium . “ Well where is he ? We kind of need him. ” <newline> The Pope squirmed a bit in his chair . “ Well , ah ... according to our ... religious records , he was ... crucified. ” <newline> The cloud of gas that was the alien 's head shifted from pale to vermillion . “ Dead ? ” His voice was soft . “ Why was he killed ? ” <newline> “ It seems that many did not appreciate the message he was spreading ... and killed him for it. ” <newline> The cloud continued to change to increasingly dark shades of red . “ So the being I explicitly put on this planet with the purpose of staying alive ... . IS DEAD ? ! ” <newline> Immediately , at least a dozen Secret Service men had raised their weapons on the alien . <newline> “ It 's okay , I 'm fine , I 'm fine. ” he said , though it sounded like he was more talking to himself than anything . “ My deepest apologies , I got a bit out of hand there. ” <newline> “ I 'd like"

A flight attendant from the front of the plane was talking to another one , but turned around to go help out the passenger . Two men sat near the back of the plane . They had met only once before , since if they were caught they needed to know as little information on one another as possible . The leader of the two went by `` John '' and the follower went by `` James '' . John and James were on a mission from God , at least in their eyes . They were there to suicide crash a plane into a New York City skyscraper . Any would do , but they needed to send a message to America . That they were not , and never would be safe . <newline> <newline> James looked nervous , so John gave him a glare . James swallowed , and grabbed the specially made plastic knife that was concealed in his bag . James was the pilot , and John was there to make sure everything went smoothly from the back . John nodded , and the stewardess reached them . <newline> <newline> `` Umm sirs ... '' she began `` Can I ask for your help ? '' <newline> <newline> James gave John a nervous look , but John was unphased . <newline> <newline> `` Yes ma'am , what 's the problem ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Are either of you a pilot ? I 'm just curious '' <newline> <newline> Maybe there was an easy way into the cockpit after all , thought John . <newline> <newline> `` Yes '' replied John `` My friend James here is a commercial pilot '' <newline> <newline> `` Can you come with me ? '' she asked <newline> <newline> James nodded , and as he got up he looked at John for guidance . John nodded at him to go . <newline> <newline> The stewardess showed him into the cockpit . The pilots were slumped over , unconscious . Panels were beeping , but the plane was stable for now on autopilot . <newline> <newline> `` Sir can you land the plane ? I came in here and they were unconscious and wo n't wake up , and I tried to call for help and all of a sudden the panels started beeping and I do n't know what to do ! '' she stammered out <newline> <newline> James was taken aback . This was n't part of the plan . He was a simple man , and did n't really know how to improvise . Under pressure like this he would get lost . <newline> <newline> `` Well I , uh , I mean uh , I guess `` he was able to get out <newline> <newline> `` Thank you sir thank so much ! '' the stewardess moved one of the pilots , and James nervously sat down . The panels were saying that the fuel was running low , and dropping fast . Maybe there was some kind of leak . It did n't like they would make it to New York . James ' heart fell , he knew John would be mad when he found out . <newline> <newline> James took the plane off autopilot and started a controlled descent . In the back of the plane , John smiled . He knew things were going well . He leaned his head back and closed his eyes . He felt calm , because he knew it would all be over soon . He decided he wanted to watch it happen . He opened his window and looked out across the city . But it was n't the city . They were low to the ground over corn fields . He swore . That imbecile James , he thought . <newline> <newline> As they approached the ground , James found a nice level field and gently eased her onto it . The plane slowly decelerated to a stop . He leaned back . <newline> <newline> The stewardess jumped up . `` You did it ! You 're a hero sir ! You saved many lives today , you will be getting an award for sure ! '' She beamed at him . <newline> <newline> He gave back a feeble smile . She walked away thinking he was just tired , but really he was terrified . They had failed their mission , and John would not be happy . He watched the passengers get off the plane one by one , congratulating him and giving him tearful thank yous . He acknowledged them all , but was really waiting for one person . <newline> <newline> The line got small , and soon everyone was off the plane , except for one man . John walked up to James . He stood there silently for a second , calm but deeply enraged inside . James stood there fearfully , waiting for what would happen . John smacked him forcefully . He glared at him , then went down the slide . James followed . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> <newline> John and James were brought around to dozens of news networks and to even more interviews from journalists , all wanting to hear the story of the Savior of flight 211 . James responded to all the questions almost honestly , but seemed rather serious . He ended up getting a medal of honor from the president for his heroics in saving so many lives . Throughout all of this , John stood in the background , silently fuming , feeling robbed of the glory he thought they would receive for their planned act ."

    "target": "I looked at the box timidly , turning it over . Just like all the others that had come before it , it was brown , and no larger than a foot in height or width . On it 's top there was a little sticker with my address on it , written in cursive with a return address . Next to the sticker was a name written in felt pen , same handwriting as the address : *David* . The old tenant of my apartment . <newline> <newline> I had never opened one . The cardboard was rough and the packaging tape meticulously done , obvious that whoever had done it had too much time on their hands . I had sent a few back , but every time they just got re-forwarded to my address . So I had begun to collect them , its not as if I have anything else to do besides play Call of Duty between my shifts at the dock . I kept them in the old hallway closet I never used , I had about fifteen at that point . <newline> <newline> However this time was different . Curiosity got the better of me , and as I sauntered to the closet , I felt the pocketknife bounce in my jeans pocket and turned around . As I sat down at my dining table I whipped it out , and sliced open the tape . <newline> <newline> Inside , there was a letter . Same handwriting as the outside . I set it aside and looked underneath . The box was full of magazines of all types . *The Economist* , *Scientific America* , *Entertainment Weekly* , *Guns and Ammo* , *Gameinformer* , even a *Maxim* were all present . Finally , at the bottom was a box of gummy worms . <newline> <newline> Sitting at my table , I had no idea how the pieces of this puzzle fit together . Remembering the letter , I turned and picked it up again . As I felt it , the textured business paper was neatly folded into perfect thirds . Opening it up , I was again hit by the cursive handwriting . <newline> <newline> *David , * <newline> <newline> There it was again . The old tenant . <newline> <newline> *I hope I 'm not bothering you , I know you are getting my packages , and I understand that you 're busy . How does your job go ? I know the docks can have long hours , but it 's rewarding is n't it ? Learning valuable skills ? * <newline> <newline> *In this package I put more of your favorite magazines , I know how you like to learn new things . I even included one of those 'girly ' magazines , you should have seen the look on the face of the teller who sold it to me ! * <newline> <newline> *Things are all good over here , your old high school is having renovations ! The heavy snow here in Michigan collapsed one of the ceilings in the western wing over the weekend . Is n't that where you used to have classes ? I 'm glad you are n't there and safe in sunny California ! * <newline> <newline> *David , I know you are n't happy with this . Every single day I regret what happened . But this is for the best , and I 'm trying here . I 've been saving , and I know that when you do get enough on your feet to apply to university I 'll have a nice little package for you . * <newline> <newline> *I 'm trying David , and you know I will never stop sending these packages until you tell me to . But please , one letter would be nice . A phone call . I just want to know how you are doing . I 'm trying , I really am .

I did n't know what to do . When I had moved in almost four months ago , I had heard about the last tenant , a legal matter , the landlord said . He had to disclose to me all prevalent information about previous tenants . <newline> <newline> Afterwards I had googled his name , David Buller ; overdose . <newline> <newline> As I looked at the letter and debated sending one back , signing it David . Or maybe I should tell her what happened . Send them back . Do something . <newline> <newline> I sat at my table for a while , and flipped through the magazines . I knew what I had to do . Going to my hall closet , I bundled up the packages , I bundled up David , and made my way to the dumpster . <newline> <newline> - *Thanks for reading ! I appreciate feedback as I 'm always looking to improve ! * -"

My squad mates would not be so lucky . They would be killed at any moment . I had nothing to fear . I have a very rare ability . My ability makes me powerful and invincible . One small detail stops me from being a demigod . My ability does not have a very large range . Of course , range depends on perspective . Sometimes I imagined my hands manipulating single atoms . Down there in the miniscule , I could reach out and alter a vast infinity . I do not live in that infinity . I live in Missouri , except I don ’ t live there now . Now I live in a muddy hole in the ground somewhere between France and Germany . <newline> I am not a normal man . I have a strange talent . I can alter probability of the world around me . I am still a man . Just like yours , my life is controlled by forces beyond my control . I am helpless against fate . I couldn ’ t keep the draft card notice from randomly showing up at my door . I couldn ’ t save my brother who volunteered 6 months before me . I couldn ’ t stop my girlfriend from careening off course and driving my motor car into the pond beside her house . My pride and joy became her coffin and final resting place . I couldn ’ t stop my mother from catching influenza and die drowning in her own bed . I could have saved her if I was there beside her , but far away from her , here in the French mud , I was just as powerless normal man . Sometimes I think those around me are unlucky to balance out my fortune . Every gift has its price ; the death of my loved ones may be the price I pay . <newline> I stop daydreaming and stand up , looking down the trench line .

I could close my eyes and ignore the sights before me , but I could never shut out the sound . I met a young man named Bill in the trenches days ago , or maybe it weeks . Every day is a moment and an eternity here in the trenches . He referred to the shelling as the Sound and the Fury . Light travels faster than sound , so here in France you see your friends die before you hear the doom that erased them . I hope Bill is alright , but he is probably isn ’ t . Maybe he is lucky like me . I cant help him , and I cant help those soldiers down the line . <newline> “ CRACK ! ” The next shell is closer . This time the sound and the fury are inseparable .

He died with his rifle in his hands and his face in the mud . I cant even save the men right next to me . If he hadn ’ t been there , that would have been me .

I will stop them all . <newline> The shells have most passed me now ; the fury falls on my friends further down the line . I walk down the line and put my hands on the dying . Sometimes , I can stop the bleeding and save them ; their blood vessels spontaneously realign and heal . Most of the time , all I can offer is mercy . The heart of my sergeant stops in his chest , the sodium ion gradient which powers it has randomly neutralized itself . Today there are no survivors , and once again I am alone . <newline> I feel the wind of the bullets whizzing by my head . The Germans are attacking across the wasteland . They are almost in range . I can feel them . They are holed up in a crater 20 yards ahead of me . I wait with focused intent . I wait until they summon the courage to attack . <newline> They are all on their feet and ready to go . Almost… Almost… I tell myself to be calm . I can hear their boots and their individual rifle fire over the shelling . “ Now ! ” , I tell myself . Seconds before they reach me a single grenade"

If I was imaginary , could I pick you up like ... *this* ? '' He wrapped his long ourangutan arms around me , and with a grunt of effort , lifted me several inches from the floor . <newline> <newline> I sighed . I hated when he forgot himself like this . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , Grafino . Yes you could . Because Lucy invented you for *me* to *play with* , once her mother told her to grow up . '' I shook my head sadly , my shimmering multicolored mane throwing out curlicue comets and pirouetting stars . <newline> <newline> Grafino 's enormous , expressive face fell , and he tugged at his lip idly , in an expression of contrition . `` I- *I 'm sorry , Max . * I forgot again . I forget sometimes . '' <newline> <newline> I felt my temper soften , and I looked at him , the sad ape wrapped in his own arms for comfort .

It 's alright , I forgive you . '' <newline> <newline> `` Hooray ! '' Grafino leapt to his feet , all melancholy of a moment ago forgotten .

Soon , the twisting , elastic vines of the Stretchy Trees would be gone again , as would the field , and the underwater Whirlpool Castle , and even the Clubhouse , that final redoubt , would begin to fade . We had never faded , me or Grafino ( named for her favorite pencil ) , but there was no telling the future . Grafino , with his half-formed mind , would forget those places , as the tight confines of the Clubhouse would become his new reality . <newline> <newline> I never forgot them . And as she slept , I would whisper the names of those forgotten places in her ear , so that she might dream them , and be happy and young and bright as she once was , and so I could see her again . <newline> <newline> For the moment , though , they were still there . And I looked over my shoulder at Grafino , and shook more nebulas from my pelt , and nodded my ascent . <newline> <newline> I took off at a run , and Grafino , as he always did , laughed in glee . <newline> <newline> <newline> THE END <newline> <newline> POSTSCRIPT : <newline> <newline> Hi !

There was something about watching the sky grow lighter and lighter as you sat your pajama 'd behind in the most powerful chair in the free world , sipping Marine strength coffee , that you just could n't achieve anywhere else . <newline> <newline> He was therefore disagreeably surprised to find a man in an understated grey suit sitting in that selfsame chair sipping tea . <newline> <newline> The President turned around and went looking for his chief of staff . <newline> <newline> `` Mitch ? Mitch ! Where in God 's name ... . '' <newline> <newline> He was met by a rotund , smiling woman who handed him an envelope and sat him down , gently but firmly , before closing the Oval Office door . <newline> <newline> `` Hello , dear '' she said and took his coffee away . The President reached for it like a child reaches for a safety blanket , only to have his wrist slapped . <newline> <newline> `` Envelope first . Once you 'd read the contents we 'll sort you out a nice cup of tea . '' <newline> <newline> He opened the envelope . <newline> <newline> He read the contents . <newline> <newline> He backhanded the teacup clear across the room and in a flurry of bathrobe he slammed through the door of the oval office and stood , quivering with fury , letter in clenched fist , glaring at the man who was sitting behind his desk . <newline> <newline> `` What in God 's name is the meaning of this ? '' thundered the President . The man sipped his tea , put the cup down on its saucer and raised an eyebrow . <newline> <newline> `` You know perfectly well what it is , you 've read it '' said the man . The voice had a calmness to it , but also a faint edge that said , without really saying it at all 'listen , johnny yank , I 've taken tea on lawns older than your country so do n't come barking at me for exposition ' , and the President found himself feeling ignorant and doltish by comparison . <newline> <newline> He sat down . <newline> <newline> `` Well , yes , I 've read it ... .

'' <newline> <newline> The man took a pair of spectacles from his jacket pocket and put them on . Then he looked over them at the President and he tutted . <newline> <newline> `` How could we not ? Honestly , my dear chap , today was completely inevitable . Look at yourself . Sitting there in your night attire , dribbling on the carpet and not for one sorry moment taking any responsibility . I 'm not normally one to critique others , but really . This is too much . '' <newline> <newline> `` But ... '' <newline> <newline> `` None of that !

'' <newline> <newline> `` See what ? '' <newline> <newline> The man sighed . <newline> <newline> `` It 's all true , is n't it ? Faced with a reasonably well educated English accent , you really ca n't help yourselves . Very well , since you appear helpless and hopeless , one last explanation . <newline> <newline> `` When you started kidnapping people and calling it `` special rendition '' , when you started surveilling your civilian population , when you armed your police with military weapons , when you restricted the freedoms guaranteed by the blood of your founding fathers , when you resorted to 'enhanced ' interrogation techniques , when the news broke about Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib , what did you think was happening ? '' <newline> <newline> `` We were safeguarding the freedoms that this country loves ! '' barked the President . <newline> <newline> The man in the suit leaned forward . <newline> <newline> `` You were doing no such thing ! '' he snapped , and the President flinched as if struck . `` In point of fact , '' the man continued `` these abuses , and others - do n't think your human rights record at home has n't made a significant contribution to this situation - have all taken you in a regrettable direction . One which has resulted in your country being handed over to a people more in keeping with that direction . <newline> <newline> It is my sad duty to inform you , sir , that you have become the villain . People feel Vladimir Putin is a more trustworthy figure . You are the Bad Guys , and as such the laws of international narrative demand that your organisation be run by an Englishman . '' <newline> <newline> `` This is insane '' <newline> <newline> `` Do n't blame me , '' said the man , picking his tea back up `` it was your movie industry that sold the idea so very effectively . Now be a good chap and get off the carpet . You speak to the nation in an hour , and hand over control to your Eton educated overlords in an hour and a quarter ."

    "prediction": "affect on campus relationships, student, student, home, student, student,, student, student, student,",
    "target": "[ **Author 's note** ] I figured I 'd give a shot at my own prompt . But just a shout out to everyone who 's posted , great stuff . I like how some people have interpreted the number as a great thing and yet there 's an understanding that some people can see it as an awful thing . <newline> <newline> I was in second term freshman year when they started . At first , a class would only have one or two . Occasionally you 'd even get a few appearing mid class . Some people would `` ooh '' and `` aww '' as the light shimmered into existence . As the numbers began to appear , people noticed that the better your GPA , the brighter the light . It was simple as that . Simple . That 's what school was like , before the markers . The worst part was that you could n't even do anything about the number . *chuckles* Hell , some kids even tried covering them up with hats at first but to no avail , the number would still glisten regardless of what you tried to cover it with . <newline> <newline> First , it was just the 4.0 's . You 'd get high fives and cheers as they started becoming normal . There 'd be shrieks coming from various buildings all over campus because friends walking through the doors were delighted see that their friend had been marked last night with a similar score . People let these numbers go to their heads . Instead of hiding , some showed them off and walked tall . I remember the first to turn of the group was Dennis . Fuckin ' Dennis . I knew the kid was smart but he was never so smug about it before , y'know ? He 'd constantly talk how he 'd get random high fives from other 4.0 's in the halls . Eventually those random people started getting names and then… well , one thing led to the next . The next day he 'd talk about a party he went to on the weekend and how he got invited to this club and so on and so on and… Well , to be honest , we do n't see Dennis too much these days . <newline> <newline> There was beginning to be a lot of them . Not the 4.0 's but just the numbers in general . It was n't rare to see a full table of kids with them at lunch time . By this time , the numbers did n't just glow A 's . As time went on , the whole damn gradient was being worked down . 3.8 's , 3.7 's , you know the rest . It was n't just on campus either . If you were enrolled in a school , you had a number . Alumni even had them . <newline> <newline> Mom and Dad were starting to get on my ass about it . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , yeah I 'll see you later . '' I was putting my shoes on when I noticed it . `` Da..Dad.. you 're marked ? '' I did n't even notice over this morning 's breakfast . <newline> <newline> *chuckles* `` Yup . '' He glanced in the mirror . `` I was wondering when I 'd see it . '' <newline> <newline> He had a faded 3.7 above his head . <newline> <newline> `` Off so soon , sweetie ? '' a voice shouted down from the stairway . <newline> <newline> `` Mornin ' hun . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ahh I see that the marks went up last night , hey ? '' My mom replied . She glanced over to me and frowned . `` Not all the marks though . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , Jim and I at the office the other day were talking about how Dave 's appeared , so it was only a matter of time . '' He cracked a smirk . <newline> <newline> I never talked to my parents about my grades , simply because they never asked . That morning , would be the first . <newline> <newline> `` You know , speaking about Jim . I saw his son at the grocery store the other day . '' <newline> <newline> I poked my head up . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , first time I 've seen him since you and him were in middle school . He 's doing great at school from what I saw . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh yeah ? That 's good to hear . '' Dad replied . `` You know , <newline> He had a 3.9 . Hah , funny store actually ! I thought it was his cashier number at first when I was in line . '' <newline> <newline> `` A 3.9 hey ? '' My dad looked at me . `` He must 've been marked pretty early on then . What about you , sport ? Where 's yours ? '' <newline> <newline> I remember fuming the whole bus ride to the train station . Sure , I was n't the best student but I tried my hardest . I was the invisible majority at the time . The kids who realized they were beginning to lose friends to the upper elite students . I pretended like I did n't see it , in myself at least . The groups were n't mixed grades anymore . They were being sifted . The larger numbers stayed together and the lower values would fall through . I hated it . I hated what school had become . I thought we were done with this high school clique bull shit . <newline> <newline> The day I cried on the train . My bus had arrived at the train"

Beneath his fingers , the woven tablecloth was grainy . He could pick out every ridge , every thread in it . They should have picked silk , like he 'd suggested . Rudy rubbed that flat of his hand across it until he came to the wineglasses . Not the crystal stemware he expected , but it felt smooth and fine nonetheless . Hunger rumbled deep in his belly . The restaurant was emptier than usual , but burbled talking he managed to filter into the background . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Mr Moore , your guests have arrived , '' the waiter whispered . Everyone learned to whisper around Rudy . The man he had chosen as his driver had n't spoken in thirty years . Rudy valued him . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` See them in , '' he replied . When they arrived , he got to his feet effortlessly , holding out a hand in the direction of their voices . Rudy sensed their surprise . A man and a woman . She wore too much perfume , but then anything more than a drop was too much perfume for Rudy . The man dragged his left foot a microscopic amount more than his right . The sound of his shoes on the carpet made Rudy 's teeth itch . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Mr Moore , '' the man started . He took his hand after a second 's hesitation . `` Daniel Coleman , and my wife Cara . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` A pleasure , '' she said smoothly .

'' There was no reason to reveal her infidelity at the dinner table . Not with the food that was coming . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Daniel was chummy . He sat too close and laughed too loud . Whippets of conversation straggled through to Rudy . A tearful exchange at the next table over ; a hurried decision to leave . Jokes . Several jokes , all of them bad . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` We came here to talk about our business proposition , '' Cara steered the conversation onto safer tracks and Rudy smiled .

'' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Gregory Lister , '' Daniel grinned . `` Genius what he does with food . You 've tasted what he can do , you know it 'll be a success . But we need your help to get us off the ground . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Just one review , '' Cara broke in . The gentle clink of dishes told Rudy that food had arrived .

He bent his face to an inch away from the food and inhaled , deeply and noisily . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> In the background , a peel of laughter broke out . Rudy frowned . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Cockles , '' he said eventually . `` Cooked in white wine , cream and saffron . Good garlic , cumin , shallots minced and salted to paste . Cooked fast and well . Added parsley , cracked black pepper and -- Is that the bread ? My goodness . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Taking a chunk of the bread , he broke it in half . Steam rose from it , fragrant as rosemary . It was soft to the touch , springy and floury . Rudy mopped it in the sauce as another peel of laughter rang out . He lifted it to his lips , enjoying the smell for one last moment before he ate the bread . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Divine , '' he said . `` But I wo n't do the review , not for any amount of money . I 'm sticking to my principles . Gregory may be an angel with food , but this poaching of chefs has gone far enough . Daniel , that injury on your left leg . It 's a burn from the arson at Francesco 's . I ca n't be part of this world any more . Restauranteering used to be an honourable trade . When did it become so full of gangsters ? '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> Another peel of laughter : like nails on a chalkboard . Rudy lifted his head . It was the same laughter every time . Again it came , again , like a glitched record . Then it dropped , and the restaurant fell to silence . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` What 's going on ? '' Rudy asked , scared . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> `` We thought you might say that , '' Daniel said . `` But we 've covered our tracks . Open your eyes , Rudy , and you 'll see what we 've done . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>"

I slept like a baby for 21 hours straight , feeling adequately refreshed for the first time since I was a child . I almost cried when I saw my reflection ; The black bag 's underneath my eyes were absent for the first time in as long as I could remember , my eyes themselves shined with reinvigorated life and my appearance as a whole seemed liberated from the drollness which had so long held my homely features captive . <newline> <newline> Most importantly however I felt good . I felt good , I felt alert , conscious of my environment and ready to go out into that big world and stop sulking in my own little corner of misery . My options seemed limitless , I could go back to school , I could start a band , I could write a book ; life had opened up to me overnight . <newline> <newline> That 's when I noticed something was there ... something was in my mind ... some sort of thorn that I did n't want to look at in the wake of my spiritual revival ...

    "target": "*My name is Tomas Klinton . And I am a dead man . * <newline> <newline> *Two days ago , the ship on which I worked , the* Sailfish *was destroyed in a storme . Before She went under , several of us managed to slip out aboard our life boat , but that too became a victim of the Storme . I awoke some time later in a surf on an unfamiliar beach . Several bodys of my crewmen were washed up alongside me . The crabs had already begun picking at some . I dug five graves for them , and sixth pit in which to keep the scavenging crabs until I had built a fyre and cooked them all . What I could not finish , I burnt andstrew about my camp . * <newline> <newline> *The daye was just passed and so I made a pile of fallen palm fronds for bedding and slept just at the edge of the beach . On my second morning , I climbed a tree and loosed a half dozen coconuts for my break fast . After liberally covering my exposed flesh with the coconut oil , I headed east along the coast . In a short tyme , I found the remains of Korl , the foreigner who had cooked for us aboard the* Sailfish . *He had a quiet temperament that usually didnot befit such a barbarian , but he had served his place amongst the crew and I buried what had not been taken by sharks . I continued along the shoreline , stopping briefly at midday to rest away from the hot sun . Throughout the afternoon , I foraged at the edge of the jungle , finding some strange , soft fruits that were rather bitter but not entirely unpleasant . Just before nightfall , I built another fyre and bed before sleeping . * <newline> <newline> *On my third day , I awoke at daybreak and spotted a large lizard batheing in the morning sun . Still sluggish from the cool night , I ran the scaly beast down . Compared to the crabs and coconuts , the lizard made a feast . I dried the leftover meat as best I could before placing it in a sling of green leaves to carry with me . * <newline> <newline> *Before the afternoon , I spotted the tattered prow of an Imperial Warshippe trapped on a bay of shoals . With great caution , I made my way out amongst the rocky coast and clambered inside the derelict . A portion of its hold was still intact , and while the food had long since spoiled , I did find several bottles of beer along with textiles , and a small ledger . Seems to have been used to keep inventory , but it now serves as my journal . Much of the hold was flooded by the hightide so I rested on what was left of the deck beneath a silken curtain and drank several of the beers as I picked at the lizard . Waking again a few hours before sunset , I explored deeper into the now accessible hold . In the lowest level , I found the bones of old sailors and a rusting sabre . While its blade is dull , it is still a better weapon that any club I could fashion . I picked up a few more beers and returned to deck to sleep through the night . * <newline> <newline> Day 4 Entry 1 <newline> <newline> *To the best of my knowledge , today is the 15th day of Spring . And since I will have no way of knowing when the next person to set eyes upon this book will be , the year is 1153 . The tide is once more high , so I will eat what is left of the lizard and repack my bag with as many beers as I can carry before returning to the beach . Perhaps I will use some of these textiles to sew better clothing ? * <newline> <newline> Day 4 Entry 2 <newline> <newline> *I thankfully managed to keep my journal dry coming back from the Warshippe . And as evidence for my improving luck , I found a freshwater stream that appears to flow down from the inland mountains . I filled the empty bottles and capped them with coconut husks . There is a nice bend here in which I will sleep for the afternoon before continuing along the beach . * <newline> <newline> Day 4 Entry 3 <newline> <newline> *It came into view several hours ago . Though what it is remains a mystery to me . In the distance , perhaps along the coast , there rises an enormous column . Perhaps that 's not quite the right word as it appears rather slender , as it can completely disappear behind a needle held at arm 's length . And yet it soars into the sky , its peak fading into the clouds . Perhaps I had spent to much time in the sun ? I will see if it is still visible in the morning . * <newline> <newline> Day 5 Entry 1 <newline> <newline> *Sure enough , I could see the Tower this morn . I find myself more curious than hungry and plan to head off immediately . * <newline> <newline> Day 5 Entry 2 <newline> <newline> *It is certainly becoming closer . But how close is it ? I tried to conceive of some way of measuring the distance to no avail this afternoon . I stopped only briefly to rest my feet . I managed to pull some fish from some small pools during the low tide , but did not stop to cook them . I suppose I should eat them , I 've had nothing all day . * <newline> <newline> Day 6 Entry"

I retire '' . * <newline> <newline> Eight months ago the whole world gasped as I said those words , and since then I 've seen them on almost every billboard . They became a new expression , a new meme . There were advertisements in which CEOs of the largest companies - our benevolent gods , our generous sponsors - stated that the would retire as well and take their business with them . A marketing campaign , for sure : they were waiting to see what trick would I pull this time to then repeat it and ride the waves of popularity . <newline> <newline> Of course , nobody in the whole world actually believed that I would actually retire , simply because I had no choice - and when I say that I do n't consider gruesome death a choice . They knew that I was stirring them up , as I always did . How could I , the Champion of WPEC - the World 's Prime Entertainment Channel , the biggest promoter of the advertisements , one of the pillars of the corporate economy , leave them ? That would imply that the corporations do not hold their word when it comes to the main currency of our world - entertainment . That would imply that they have no power . That was a pill that nobody even contemplated they would have to swallow one day . <newline> <newline> For the last 15 seasons , I have been surviving as I could , trying to earn my freedom .

But I never predicted one thing : that I would be too good to leave the show . The public loved me , they did n't want to part with my crazy shenanigans , and the fact that had I failed to entertain them better than everybody else I would be thrown under the road roller never bothered them . To think that I used to be like them ... <newline> <newline> They think I still am , but that 's not true . The things I 've done , the things I 've seen ... They 've changed me , shaped me into someone who had to wear two faces - one for myself , and one for the others . I 've heard how the public roared after I harpooned a shark and then rode it , and I 've seen other contenders break down in tears because they knew that they could n't top me , and that the audience would relish in their deaths . <newline> <newline> So I decide to up the game one more time . <newline> <newline> As usual , the crowd greets me with deafening cheers . They refuse to believe that I am going to retire . Time to tell them otherwise . <newline> <newline> `` Greetings , beautiful people ! '' - I roar , smiling , and in response , I feel another sonic wave of my fans ' screams . `` I got ta tell you something important '' - immediately the crowd , all the 11 million people that gathered here , all the kings of this world , go silent . `` While I was playing the game , all my relatives died '' - I say , and the crowd makes the loudest `` Awww ! '' sound in the world . <newline> <newline> `` But that 's fine because I got you guys ! '' - I yell , and people cheer in ecstasy . `` Oh , all the crazy stuff we did ! Remember that time when I wrote a mocking letter to that Eastern dictator and almost caused a global conflict ? '' - I ask , and the crowd laughs . `` Remember when I made a bomb and tried to blow up the popcorn factory to cause popcorn rain ? '' - I ask , and the crowd laughs louder . <newline> <newline> `` Remember '' - I ask in a quiet voice - `` when I said that I would retire ? '' . <newline> <newline> In response , I only hear the unsure muttering . <newline> <newline> `` That day is today '' - I say , and suddenly the front rows of the stadium start blowing up , cowering the back rows in fire and ashes and blood and bones .

    "target": "**Secret of the Slaves** <newline> <newline> I was raised by my mother along with my siblings in a home that more accurately could have been described as a castle . I remember the high halls ' walls being covered in exquisite art , the seats in the many living rooms all being as big as royal thrones , and the food being plenty , fresh , and nourishing . The slow slave-race provided for our every need and every whim . As kids we often played with the servants , although our mother disapproved . We thought it was great fun . <newline> <newline> As a youngster , when the time came , me along with one of my brothers were shipped off to take care of our own estate . In our new home already resided a middle aged gentleman , who had been taking care of the household and the resident slaves . He was glad to have some company , since he had been living there all on his own , with only the dull-minded attendants as very silent companions . He taught us how to behave elegantly , as was appropriate for our esteem . He taught us to hunt in the vast forests that opened up behind our residence , and he taught us how to appropriately handle the slaves when the need arose . <newline> <newline> They were quite well trained already by our mentor , so we were taught about positive reinforcement and how to communicate that to the race of idiots . Sometimes , when we wanted done something that was difficult to get across , we tried speaking to the slaves - not like we spoke to each other , of course , they could n't possibly comprehend the intricacy of language - but like we would talk to small children , like our mother had spoken to us when we were still struggling to learn to walk . Sometimes they seemed to get this light of understanding in their proportionately small eyes and they would comply with our request , but at least as many others they would just stare and mumble . The slaves were n't perfect , but they were easy to train to do the simple stuff , so almost every household had them . <newline> <newline> But at times they needed to be shown discipline . One of them would forget to start the meal , or would go outside at night , get lost , and not return before the next day , for example . And because their much heavier build than ours , they would sometimes unwittingly hurt us while giving a massage . On these occasions , we were taught the appropriate punishments . We would slap them and curse at them , deny them our signs of affection , and on one particularly crude offense - I can not recall specifically what that was , since it has been quite some time since the transgression occurred - our mentor took us in his tow , went to the offending slave 's sleeping chamber and proceeded to urinate on the slave 's bed . We were quite young , and shocked , but as we grew older , we realised that the punishment was indeed necessary to keep the dullards in line . <newline> <newline> Our lives were filled with activities suitable for gentlemen of noble blood in their veins . One of them was not the pondering of the slaves ' intelligence . It was n't a taboo , per se , there just was very little interest in such a subject . I , however , were , and still am , quite intriqued by them . When we reached the age of adulthood , and our mentor became our peer , no longer holding any power over our activities and pursuits , I dedicated most of my free time in the study of those clumsy , slow beasts that roamed our halls . <newline> <newline> I observed them , mostly on their spare time from their duties , when they tended to group together , and noticed that they seemed to display some social behaviours . They would huddle close to each other , like they were seeking comfort , and just stare . They were mysterious creatures , I was sure of that . <newline> <newline> A breakthrough of sorts came one night when I was awoken from my slumber by some wandering thought or other . I was n't feeling tired anymore , so I got up and wandered the halls until I found the slaves in one of the rooms . They were gathered around a table , feeding . It had never occurred to me that they also ate at night , so I decided to observe them a little . It seemed like they were having a feast - there was more food in front of them than usually , which alone is a really poor measure of a feast , but I did n't think critical thought would really be necessary at this hour . Then I noticed something odd . <newline> <newline> They seemed to be making noises . With very low voices , one or two slaves would vocalise at a time , followed by other , slightly higher voicalizations from the other ones . It seemed to have a pattern , like ... a language . <newline> <newline> I knew I would propably never come to understand their language , if it even was that , and not my sleepy mind 's flight of fancy . It was incomprehensible - they used minimal body language and instead made lots of noises , like little children , or some pray animals like birds . But the prospect had opened my mind forever to the possibility that these beings , slow and stupid as they were , could also be sentient ."

Where are those damned things ? * <newline> <newline> Dave was yet again lost in the seemingly endless maze of aisles that made up his local chain grocery store . Despite doing all of his shopping here for the last three years , he had never been able to remember where anything was found . Not that he minded ; getting lost was the perfect excuse to approach the love of his life , Helen . Helen was of diminutive stature , nearly always smelled of mint , and possessed what could be described only as an utterly confusing laugh . Her normal , conversational voice was relatively high , yet whenever amused she would emit the deepest baritone waves of laughter Dave had ever heard . Dave loved it , loved everything about this quirky , bright-eyed girl perpetually seated behind the cash register . <newline> <newline> Building up his courage for the inevitable conversation with Helen , Dave downed an Alprazolam and ran over potential topics of discussion in his mind . *Last week I tried fish , and that did n't work so well . Cucumbers though ... I do n't see any cucumbers near her station . Maybe I 'll bring up the weather as well , seeing as the rains have finally subsided . * <newline> <newline> Helen glanced up from her Sudoku puzzle , which was nearing completion . Scanning her eyes over her surroundings , she noticed someone had yet again spread mayonnaise all over the People Magazine display located by Register 12 . *Of all things those bastards could have chosen to smear , why does it always have to be mayonnaise ? * She prepared to call for someone to handle the situation over the intercom , when out of the corner of her she noticed Dave . Dave always gave off an awkward impression . It did n't matter how many times she had met him , she just could not get over his constant state of nudity , nor the ever present erection stiffly penetrating his belly button . Furthermore , he was always sweating , even with the A/C running at full blast . Despite what to most people would be glaring flaws , Helen could n't help but feel somewhat charmed by Dave . *Oh Dave* , she thought , *that poor fellow just ca n't seem to remember anything* . <newline> <newline> Dave approached the the desk and gave a beaming , toothy grin . `` Helen ! Is it you that the Greeks fought so gallantly for against the vile Trojans ? '' Helen stifled a deep , throaty giggle and replied with a warm `` Hey ! How can I help you today , Dave ? '' . David waited another moment , seemingly at loss for words . He redirected his eyes towards the mayonnaise-defiled display , before abruptly turning on his heels and racing out the door . Helen sighed , and called the nearby mental hospital that was now saved on speed-dial in her phone . Once connected with the operator , Helen explained `` Dave was here again ... You 'll want to bring some clothes probably , he was in one of those ... *moods* . '' <newline> <newline> After receiving confirmation that help was on the way , Helen made as if to reach down below the cash register . Once obscured from the prying eyes of the public , she began sobbing . It took every portion of her being to hold back the sonorous wailing that could at any moment overtake her . After a few minutes she regained control , and raced to the bathroom to clean her face of her now-running mascara . Only a few feet away from the bathroom door she slipped in the mayonnaise . With a resounding THWACK her skull met the concrete floor , and a dark void consumed her ."

How could the beast look so relaxed now . How could he be at peace after all the death , after all the fighting . <newline> <newline> `` You do not deserve to rest now beast .

Look now Arkhale , look to the East . '' <newline> <newline> Before he even turned he heard it . He watched as the great city was destroyed . <newline> <newline> `` Now Arkhale , you must go into the cave , it 's the only way you and your family will survive .

'' <newline> <newline> Arkhale grabbed his family and pulled them inside . A strange sensation came over him as he stepped past the translucent black orb that stood at it 's entrance . He turned for one final look at the beast . <newline> <newline> The beast gathered it 's last bit of strength and spread it 's mighty wings across the entrance of the cave . <newline> <newline> `` Step aside now beast or we will go through you . '' Shouted the prince . `` Step ASIDE ! '' <newline> <newline> But it was too late , the last thing Arkhale saw before being consumed by the cave was the white hot light of destruction pass over the prince and his army and the dragon 's peaceful face as he turned to Arkhale and nodded . <newline>"

The power of attraction of the Masks does not go well with groups of people . In the end , there is only one person who can have it . The others fated to begin the cycle again , or disband . <newline> <newline> I had followed the rumors , from Boston to Chicago , from Chicago to Philly , from Philly to New York , and back , so many times . Everybody knows that the quest in long but not vain , at least for a few of us , the lucky ones . But there are n't many BFs left now , at least not active . Most of them have taken to the Undergroud , this restricted facility the guys at CERN were secretely working on . Its size unfathomable , its magnetic properties making it a safe haven for BFs everywhere . I knew the access points to join it , but I also knew I still had Mask fever . I could not give up . <newline> <newline> With the disappearance of most of the competition after all these years , the hunt had become easier , but somehow even more dreadful . Walking around the wastelands , searching for the magnetic signature of the Masks with the detector , exhausted all day , lonely all night . The Masked Ones still roam certain regions ( but nobody can confirm it ) , but they have mostly deserted the wastelands . Most of them now rule over empty areas all over the world , their power unlimited , their subjects inexistant . For some reason they 're alone . <newline> <newline> I was going along Madison Avenue , one of the few streets still manageable on foot . I knew my detector would not last long , but I did not care anymore . A rumor had started , not only the usual one about a peak of magnetic activity in this or that region of the world , causing all BFs still active to gather there . I had heard from someone that the detector was useless . That we did not pick up any of the Masks ' signatures . No , it was something else , something that could change the whole hunt for ever if I could prove it , for myself . <newline> <newline> It 's said that the Masked Ones are not all devoid of interest for the BFs . It 's said that the ones that did not become omnipotent and power-crazed chose to stay attached to the places they lived in before they ascended to another state of conscience , before the symbiotic Mask turned them into selfish , immortal , mostly harmless Gods on this earth -harmless as long as you did n't live in an area they ruled over . Someone said only a Masked One can find a Mask and grant it to a BF , and that the transitivity of it all first began when they excavated the first Mask inside the Mojave Desert . Our first God , a woman , was said to have started the first lineage of Masked Ones . How this information had remained unknown to the rest of humanity so far was baffling , and I did not put all my remaining eggs in this crazy basket . But the Mask historian I had talked it out with was pretty convinced . Before the fall of all civilizations , before the Mojave black hole , the disappearance of Japan and the complete destruction of all electronic apparatus , this man had tried to follow the pattern of the Gods ' appearances . He had cross-referenced all Ground Zero events , even the most ridiculous ones , to the background checks on the people known to have become Masked Ones . He found pairs , sometimes triplets of Gods originating from roughly the same areas . Masked Ones created Masked Ones , according to him . I had nothing to lose , and I had heard crazier theories . <newline> <newline> My coming back to New York , my hometown , had not been uneventful . One of the last troups of BFs had sheltered me for a while , before going mad and ripping itself appart , its members succombing to the awful paranoia the newly imposed world order ( or disorder ) and surperimposed crazy magnetic fields inevitably triggered amongst groups of two and more human beings . The Masks completely screw the brain 's chemistry , and the initial instinct of grouping ourselves for survival is sure to slowly transform into a greed-infused paranoia over the remaing Masks , even if the group had swore to never take part in the quest . Poor bastards were probably contaminated by my mere presence . Nobody really knows how it works , which is why people still try to form troups . Guess I ca n't blame them . Now I was walking along the path I used to take to go to work , unsure of what I was going to find . I knew there were other lone BFs in the area , New York is never really deserted , even if the magnetic fields are"

He put his head down on the table and cried into his arms . The master gave a blank stare . <newline> <newline> `` Calm down ! I 'm not dead yet , '' Sagramor declared . The hero got up and wiped his face with his sleeves . An awkward silence came between them until the hero thought about his original question . <newline> <newline> `` Listen ... I 'm sorry . Just ... can you please answer one question ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Certainly . '' <newline> <newline> `` What am I supposed to do now ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , what do you want to do ?

'' <newline> <newline> `` Good . This may prove to be your greatest challenge yet . Greater than anything you have faced so far . Are you ready to accept this challenge , soldier ?

    "target": "Gareth woke , his heart pumping with excitement . The day he had dreamt of was finally upon him . Today was his first day as a cleric ! <newline> <newline> Gareth rose from his bed , and walked over to the lone table in his humble dwelling . Dipping his hands into the clay bowl , he splashed water onto his face . The water was frigid , and with a jolt his body seemed to wake up , his skin now prickling with the same exhilaration that he felt in his chest . It was as if his whole being , body and soul , was pulling him out the door and towards the church where his fellow monks were waiting for him . He donned his brown hooded robe , tied the white cord of his Brotherhood around his waist , and walked out the door . <newline> <newline> “ Gareth ! Good morning to you ! ” Father Dormund was the head of their Holy Order , the Brotherhood of the Silver Horn . Gareth had always looked up to him , even though he stood a head shorter . As he greeted Father Dormund with the Brotherhoods customary embrace , Gareth barely managed to clasp his hands around the man ’ s plump frame . <newline> <newline> “ Good morning to you , Father Dormund ! I am looking forward to working with you and my new Brothers to further spread our message . I can not help but feel that I have been created solely for this purpose ! ” <newline> <newline> “ Fantastic ! We shall not delay then . Come , a meeting is planned . We have to discuss a very important matter. ” Father Dormund led the way into the small meeting hall off the main sanctuary . <newline> <newline> As Gareth took a seat , he met Brothers Abernathy and Michael . They too were starting out as new clerics today . Abernathy was a man a few years older than Gareth , a short black beard growing on his chin . Michael , compared even to Father Dormund , appeared very old . His long white beard was so long , he could have tucked it into the cords around his waist . <newline> <newline> “ Brothers , may I have your attention , please ? ” Father Dormund was standing in front of a map of the countryside surrounding their city , Aginhold . His seemed incredibly sullen compared to the man he had met just moments ago . “ Today is a day of great loss . Our dear Brother Derrick has gone missing . He left yesterday on a secret mission . He was taking our Sacred Silver Horn north , to an old Holy Site . Once a year , the Horn must be taken to this Site to be cleansed of evil . As you know , the Silver Horn is special due to its power to steal evil words and thoughts from us and the surrounding lands . It collects all our evil thoughts and words , and in doing so , helps to prevent crime in our land . The evilness must be cleansed from the Silver Horn once a year , or it will cease to work . Brother Derrick was tasked with cleansing the Horn this year , and was due to arrive back today . As you can see , he is not among you , and the Horn is not hanging in our sanctuary ! ” <newline> <newline> “ Father Dormund , ” Gareth couldn ’ t help himself but blurt out , “ What can we do to help ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I was getting to that . I need each of you to go out into the city and the countryside . I want you to look for anyone that might be willing to help us . We will need someone who is strong and cunning to track down our lost Brother Derrick and bring back the Silver Horn . Spread out , tell all of our plight , and pray that someone might be willing to help us ! ” <newline> <newline> Gareth took up a position at Aginhold ’ s southern gate . He anticipated that this would be a good place to look for wandering adventurers , as there was a large seaport to the south that brought new people in every day . Perhaps among one of these newcomers , someone would come who would be able to help him and his Brotherhood . <newline> <newline> Shortly thereafter , he saw a shape coming up the road . A man clad in Bronze armor from head to toe walked directly towards him . <newline> <newline> “ Hello traveler ! ” Brother Gareth began . “ What is your name ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Surfsup619 . Do you have a Quest for me ? ” <newline> <newline> Gareth could barely register the strange name before he found himself responding . “ Yes , Surfsup619 ! I am a member of the Brotherhood of the Silver Horn . Our Sacred Silver Horn has gone missing , along with a member of our order , Brother Derrick . Would you be willing to search for him and bring back our Sacred Horn , and Brother Derrick if possible ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I will accept your Quest . Do you have any clues that I can use to find Brother Derrick ? ” <newline> <newline> “ All I know his he left our church and headed north. ” <newline> <newline> “ Not much to go on . I suppose I ’ ll have to use my Tracking skill to follow his path. ” Without another word , Surfsup619 began to walk into Aginhold , toward the church . <newline> <newline> “ Thank you , kind traveler ! Good luck !"

I searched for the show on IMDB… nothing . For some reason , I couldn ’ t remember any of the actors ' names . It was killing me . I even googled general information about the show to make sure I didn ’ t get the name wrong .

Good luck with the screenplay - you have to let me read it when it ’ s done ! ” <newline> <newline> After I hung up , I stared at my computer screen for a long time . Pure disbelief .

I can recall so much.. all of the subplots and even some of the memorable lines . <newline> <newline> I ’ m not sure what came over me , but at some point , I opened up a Word document . It ’ s strange , but since I was little , I ’ ve always thought about what would happen if I could delete a song , TV show , or movie , or something like that from existence , and then only I would be able to remember it . So then I could recreate it , become rich and famous , and live life free and easy . <newline> <newline> I 'm not gon na question it . TS was the best show ever . A guaranteed hit .

Everyone of them are forgettable , the social spot light is clearly their biggest fear , even now I have a tough time remembering what they look like . <newline> <newline> The social constructs of high school just do n't click with me . Any label as a hippy , an outcast , a hipster , a heathen , has no affect on me or my friends . <newline> <newline> My school is very religious . I was invited to pray at the flagpole in the morning by like 20 people . After denying their invitation , my group of friends and I have been labeled outcasts . Satanist rumors started after my friend Greg brought his sister 's tarot cards to school for a joke . The real funny part of the rumor is that we have been devoutly ostracized , being avoided in the hall , scared faces and persistently silent are all we get if we just so happened to need to borrow a pencil . <newline> <newline> When I was a kid , I was actually kidnapped by a biker gang . My father was apparently working with them and then things went downhill . The worst memory I have is watching the absolute fear in my father 's eyes . Ignoring my mother 's pleas to explain himself , he packed his bags , told us where to find three million dollars and ran out the door . <newline> <newline> My father burned out and blazed down the road . Five seconds later , a biker gang rolled up to our house . We led them to the money , but it was only half of what my father embezzled from them . So they took me , told my mother she better hope my father show back up and within an hour 's time , my mother went from happy house wife , to hopelessly distraught . <newline> <newline> All I remember was , I was blind folded in a van and then my blind fold was taken off at some rusty , old bar . I was screaming and crying , their solution , `` give him some ayehuasca . '' <newline> <newline> For nine hours , I was in another universe , where physical laws of cause and effect were none existent , where the contents of my subconscious took form . My evil , miser of a grandpa took form , the way I perceived the robot people were personified as faceless people . After all the emotionally upsetting stuff subsided , an eye appeared , the eye was me , I looked at the eye , the eye at me , I looked into myself , and saw absolutely nothing and absolutely everything at the same time . <newline> <newline> I lost my sense of self , and then he appeared . He was me and I was him , the other half to my soul , the ying to my yang , my dark matter to my regular matter , a complete , opposite reflection of me . I knew that if I merged into my other half , that we would be obliterated into the ultimate destiny , becoming one in the same with the spirit of it all . Before parting with one another , I was presented an icon , a symbol of the inseparable spiritual connection I have with my other half . I do n't tell anyone about my drug trip . <newline> <newline> I woke up wearing a black bag on my head . In the next room , I can hear the door bust open , a bunch of wrestling around , and two big thugs on the ground . A gunshot goes off , another thud , some plastic rolling around , and my father is dead . I feel a hand go over my mouth , I pass out and wake up under a highway overpass . To this day I swear I 'll bring justice , I do n't know how , I do n't know who they are , but I 'll find them . <newline> <newline> And that leads me to now , looking out the window in math class , drawing `` the symbol '' for the millionth time .

I reach into my bag and I stab my finger , I immediately pull my hand away and a drop of blood falls on the paper . <newline> <newline> Instantly my heart seized by an extreme amount of energy , and I could feel the same thing from my opposite . Time stops , everyone in the classroom freezes in place , the leaves outside stand still while midair , my body willfully frozen , my thoughts willfully turned off , so that I may fully experience the moment . <newline> <newline> My heart starts pulsating , the room starts rumbling , a loud hum shakes me to my core . Suddenly a green cord shoots out from my chest , my heart is connected with my opposite . The humming gets louder and louder ,"

The cravings had gotten so bad that my dreams began to revolve around pie . I would wake up every morning with the distant taste of lemon in my mouth , and feeling phantom crumbs on my hands . Enough was enough , so I drove around on my day off , looking for somewhere with lemon merengue pie . When I saw it in the dessert display case at my local diner , I felt more overjoyed about a pastry than I thought was even possible . The hostess lead me to my seat , and handed me a menu . I had been too busy searching for pie to eat lunch , so I figured I 'd get a panini before my pie . <newline> <newline> I downed several glasses of water before my lunch was brought over . It was a futile attempt to stop myself from imagining the taste of lemon . I did n't even know what brought on the pie cravings .

Soon enough , my panini was in front of me , and then gone . <newline> <newline> `` Would you like dessert ?

The sweet-sour of the lemon would be like a breath of fresh air after being stuck in a stuffy room for too long . The creamy merengue was a siren 's call that I was happily going to let lure me to my death . I would quite possibly kill someone for lemon merengue pie at that moment , but it did n't matter . I was going to get my pie soon . <newline> <newline> Lost in my dessert delirium , I did n't hear the waiter approach my table until he spoke . <newline> <newline> `` Sorry , Miss , but we 're out of lemon merengue pie .

Why would I have them ? I did n't need them . <newline> <newline> *Who am I ? How 'd I get here ? * <newline> <newline> I tried clearing my head . The lingering effects of the pain quickly subsided , and I stood . I was in the center of a grand hall . Marble floors lay before me , with intricate murals depicting great battles with monsters and man alike . The walls were adorned with weapons of every type ; Each hung with care and easily accessible . The pillars reached hundreds of feet up , and the thousands of candles hung from chandeliers from the vaulted ceiling . <newline> <newline> I had no memory of anything , and I knew I should be afraid . Yet I felt only a steady calm . Picking a direction , I began walking . Perhaps I will run into someone . Perhaps I 'll find my own way out . <newline> <newline> I passed a shield that had been brightly shined to a mirror finish . The mural on the wall depicted an athletic looking man using the shield to fight a monstrous woman with snakes for her hair . Looking into the mirror , I caught a reflection of myself . Skinny . Slicked black hair cut short , but without regard for any style . The marks on the bridge of my nose indicated a lifetime of wearing glasses . Pocket protector in my breast pocket . Two mechanical pencils and an eraser . A Timex watch adorning my thin wrists . <newline> <newline> Seeing my reflection , a memory surged forward . College . I was coming out of a classroom when a beautiful girl with long brown hair asked me for help on her calculus homework . I knew her . I do n't know how I knew her , only that there was a painful familiarity . <newline> <newline> I kept moving . The next exhibit to catch my eye was a massive war-hammer . The murals surrounding that depicted a warrior fighting off hordes of blue crystalline giants . It was a beautiful weapon , and I instinctively reached out to touch it . <newline> <newline> Memory flashed before my eyes again . I was in the hospital now . That beautiful girl was crying . Not in pain , in joy . I was there with her , crying . We were holding a healthy infant girl . My daughter ? A voice was screaming in my head now , but I could n't make it out . There was something I needed to remember , but I could n't dredge it forward . <newline> <newline> I forced myself to keep moving . I saw an exquisite broadsword , embedded in the wall . The murals depicted a beautiful and ethereal woman standing in the center of the lake , bequeathing the sword to a regal looking man . I reached out to grab the pommel , bracing myself for the memories to come . <newline> <newline> I saw myself , sitting at a desk , being visited by a sympathetic policeman . He was telling me that my daughter and wife had been killed . I staggered for a bit , as the memory of that loss hit me in full . <newline> <newline> I remembered their names . Alexandra . Ava . My wife . My daughter . I remembered everything about them . Our lives together . Watching Ava grow . Making love to my wife . Sweet sunsets spent together as a family at the dinner table . Long road-trips filled with obnoxious sing-alongs . Yet I could not remember my name . <newline> <newline> Another weapon . This time , a spear . The murals showed an army of 300 facing against an impossibly large horde . I recalled feverishly working every night , often going days without eating or sleeping . I was driven . Diving into paperwork . Digging into stacks of records . Always searching . Again , my identity eluded me , lurking at the very cusp of consciousness . <newline> <newline> A sling and a heavy rock . The murals depicted a slender young boy facing against an absolute giant of a man . I remembered being in court . My relentless search yielded fruit , and I was giving testimony . The trial lasted for weeks , and in between court sessions , messages were delivered to me . They alternated between promises of great wealth and of painful deaths . I was driven , ignoring all entreaties and threats . And finally , I was vindicated . I nailed the ones responsible for the murder of my wife and child with tax evasion . <newline> <newline> I had reached the end of the hall . And there stood before me a simple abacus . A robust construction of wood and steel . And I knew this was mine . No murals surrounded it . I reached out to grab it , and the last of the pieces fell into place . I was beaten . Tortured . They kept me alive for weeks , as an example to others . And through it all , I never once gave my torturers the satisfaction of crying out for mercy . <newline> <newline> I remembered my name . I am Ted . I am an accountant ."

The two of them stood on the very edge of the ridge , a dangerous place to most . But barely worth considering for the two of them . <newline> <newline> Korvin shook his head in answer . It seemed he was in for a story . Father was usually the storyteller , but he had teleported ahead , and was already down in the valley they overlooked . <newline> <newline> `` When the first gods created this universe , with all the worlds it contains '' She began `` They fucked things right up . What 's with that look boy ? Did you think just because they were the first that they were infallible ? Nope . The worlds they created had great , gaping holes in them , leading out into the great void . Make no mistake , we live in a giant bubble , floating aside other bubbles in a universe of endless nothingness . '' <newline> <newline> Korvin was starting to remember why his father was the storyteller , but he remained silent and dutifully listened as his mother continued to speak , her eyes to the valley . <newline> <newline> `` Anyway , the worlds were leaking , and ... things were starting to come inside . Things made of nothingness . But you know all about them , the deathlords the sword gods and all the saints and paladins under them fight . As usle ...

An instant later , the air behind them warped and twisted before a tall man wearing a simple robe with a sky blue sash around his waist stepped out of nothingness onto the plateau . Korvin 's mother relaxed instantly from where she had moved behind the point of teleportation . <newline> <newline> `` Oh , hello dear , how did it go ? '' <newline> <newline> The man placed an arm around his wife with a careless gesture that told nothing of the many , many years they had been together . <newline> <newline> `` He 's adamant that he has the edge '' He explained `` Apparently it 's going to be the prize for this year 's tournament . He would n't tell me what it looked like or even if he had confirmed what it could do ... not that there would have been many opportunities for that . It looks like we are going to have to enter this year . <newline> <newline> He frowned in consternation . <newline> <newline> `` Even if it 's only a rumor , Lartin is biting off more than he can chew with this one .

'' <newline> <newline> Korvin did n't even bother to wonder how his father knew what they had been talking about , one of the benefits to being a six century old wizard . <newline> <newline> `` Yes , well '' She turned back to Korvin . `` Wherever the first gods have messed up , the silver lady has always been there to rectify things . Do n't even ask where she came from because that 's a true mystery . Anyway , the sliver lady could push the deathlords back into the void , or simply erase their anti life energy with her own with childish ease , but she could n't be everywhere at once . Gradually , the newly forged worlds were being overrun . '' <newline> <newline> As always , she was still when she talked , well ingrained into the habit of making no unnecessary movements . <newline> <newline> `` So she decided to split a part of herself off , and use it to make guardians who would represent her , fighting back the dreadlords .

She can not simply change like that , it would undermine the foundation of reality itself . So she had to get creative . '' <newline> <newline> She turned to look Korvin directly in the eyes , it seemed like she was determined for him to take what she was saying seriously . <newline> <newline> `` Legend says , that she made a blade .

Levelling up was like having birthdays - just wait around long enough and you 'll get there - but it was a bit inconvenient to have to wait . If I had a choice I ’ d skip all the tutorial stages of life , but this wasn ’ t an option , at least in this particular map . Everything was like a video game - scripted , pixellated , pre-digested - and you were at the whim of the player controlling you . <newline> <newline> The funny thing is , even though no-one seemed to know , or remember - I remembered . I remembered a time when this was n't the case , when we were n't restricted by birth or skill or choice to use items only we could use . Once upon a time we could walk up the stairs without having to wait for Level 2 walking and the obligatory +5 balance boost . <newline> <newline> Anyway I 'd forgotten all of this when I tried to fry an egg this morning . <newline> <newline> I reached for the pan , but the pan buzzed .

I was able to use this skill not two mornings prior . As it stood , there was nothing for it but to grind ... and grind . <newline> <newline> I looked around for eggs to crack . There were maybe a half-dozen left in the fridge , and I plucked two of them out , waving away the text . *Egg-cracking tutorial* , it 'd read .

The world 's been a bit weird recently . <newline> <newline> In the background , orange and green numbers floated up from the bowl as I cracked the eggs . +5 ! +10 ! BONUS POINTS ! As weird as it might seem , there was a strange sense of comfort in knowing you were doing the right thing . A weird ... satisfaction ? Something in the grind that tells you that you ’ re doing a good job ? The psychological linking of action to reward that gave rise to satisfaction ? Anyway , it didn ’ t take long before I finally levelled up . <newline> <newline> I reached out for the frying pan , and this time the game didn ’ t block me from touching the pan . A rumbling sounded outside . It was going to be another cloudy morning . I poured a bit of oil into the pan and went to get something else . <newline> <newline> I didn ’ t notice the puddle of water until it was too late . <newline> <newline> The second my feet made contact I knew I had made a mistake .

Everything else seemed like normal - the skies were still grey , the oil was still smoking - but nevertheless something had changed . There had been zero protection . The game had not stopped me - it was conceivable I could have died . And then I saw the words . <newline> <newline> “ Fix reality goggles ? ” I whispered . `` Wait just a moment ... '' <newline> <newline> The words had flashed briefly across my world . Curiously enough , these were in Times New Roman , and they lasted nowhere as long as the Comic Sans level up notifications - but nevertheless they were there . <newline> <newline> *Great .

What kind of a world is out there ? * <newline> <newline> “ Yes , ” a voice spoke in my head . “ The goggles were meant to protect you from doing stupid things . For example , you are currently floating two feet above the ground. ” <newline> <newline> I looked down , and I felt dizzy - there was daylight between my feet and the ground .

Initially , I 'd convinced myself that the house was exactly how I 'd wanted it to be , but only now was I able to realise that all this time I was just protecting myself from the truth of the matter , which was that I 'd wasted a good fortune seeking a thrill , only for it to not even come close to my expectations at the end of it all .

I would say it 's not because of something you 've done and that it 's a decision I 've made due to personal circumstances , however , quite frankly , that would not be true . * <newline> <newline> *When I first saw the advertisement about a haunted apartment up for sale , with pictures of the ghosts ( you guys ) and all as proof , I was thrilled . At the time , my life was quite mundane ; the business was booming , I was getting richer , and that was just about it . So naturally , this felt like a perfect opportunity to change things up . * <newline> <newline> *It was a win-win situation , really . Either , I would stay at the house for a couple of months , get the life scared out of me , and leave with some great stories to tell or if not that , perhaps a ghost would make me say goodbye to this well lived life and guide me over to paradise , for me to live my next one . * <newline> <newline> *Unfortunately , the three of you did n't manage to accomplish either of those two for me . Instead you 've left me feeling as if I 've wasted two years of my life , and though I did n't have anything spectacular planned for them , I ca n't help but feel bitter . I 'm a businessman after all . * <newline> <newline> *I wo n't deny that you tried to serve your purpose by coming up with plans to horrify me , however , they were just executed so poorly that I could n't help but wonder if all ghosts were astoundingly incompetent or if I 'd just had the misfortune of coming across the only three who were . * <newline> <newline> *Now , I 'm not writing this to merely insult you .

Let 's take it from the start . * <newline> <newline> *The bloodstain on the carpet when I first moved in . Everyone and their mothers ' have read The Canterville Ghost . The worst part is n't even that you copied the same tactic , it 's that you obviously went through the book yourself and ignored the fact that the tactic did n't work out at all for the Ghost of Canterville . The lesson to be learnt here is be original , but more importantly , do n't be stupid . * <newline> <newline> *Next , the fact that your classic scary attires look like white bedsheets with holes for eyes . I stopped myself from laughing the first 4 times I came across the three of you just so you would n't feel bad . It was almost like you were pretending to be ghosts . * <newline> <newline> *On the note of pretending , the howls and the shrieks and the screams . They had no heart in them . You 've got to make them real guys . Maybe some vocal lessons will help . * <newline> <newline> *Overall , this has been quite a disappointing experience for me as I 'm sure you can already tell . * <newline> <newline> *None the less , I wish you all well and hope one day , you learn enough to be able to take revenge on me for the absolutely disgusting review I 'll be leaving for the house . * <newline> <newline> -- -- <newline> <newline> Did n't proofread so the tenses and grammar are probably incorrect in some places . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>"

They could not have had the resources necessary to perform an operation of this size . <newline> <newline> Then the second letter came and it promised to kill her by the end of July . The emails still flooded in , full force , but the addresses all bounced when replied to . IPs were traced , and ended up in the middle of the Pacific . Whoever Sienna ’ s stalker was , he knew what he was doing . <newline> <newline> When they found Sienna , she was something more than beautiful . It was the way she lay spread-eagle on the floor of her bedroom with her hair framing her face and her throat slit in a gaping wide smile , her eyes closed so softly she could have been sleeping , the blood pooling around her torso , still warm and that vibrant red of sunsets and cherries and hastily applied lipstick , her lavender perfume still carrying on the air . <newline> <newline> The policemen designed to protect her lay slumbering outside her house , evidently drugged by some foreign substance that had somehow been administered without their knowledge . <newline> <newline> ( I used NyQuil and lemonade . ) <newline> <newline>"

And then as the minutes wore by I realized that they were actually serious , they meant it . And I laughed again . <newline> <newline> The funny part this time had been in that they actually took it seriously . Not that it was n't a serious subject , but that they were actually worried about being caught . They were actually worried about some sort of Washington Post expose with Murdergate headlines . Seriously ? <newline> <newline> I was part of the 1 % of the 1 % , receiving millions every month on royalties on my patent rights alone . I 'd taken a page out of Microsoft 's book and invested heavily in all of my biggest competitors . No matter who won out in the end , I 'd win . Even if I lost , I was still going to win when I liquidated my company . And of course if I won I was really going to win once I liquidated them . It was impossible for me to run out of money -- unless I assigned the task to others it was impossible for me to spend more money than I made . Of course the President wanted to be my best friend -- every political figure everywhere wanted to be my best friend . <newline> <newline> So when they told me that I had to murder someone , that there was actually this mystic importance placed on it , when they showed me data , when they got serious about how important it was that I kill and not get caught or the supernatural don't-break-the-masquerade police would execute me on the spot I could n't stop laughing . <newline> <newline> Once I got myself under control , I placed a few calls and made a few donations . I now own the largest nonprofit abortion clinics in every state . Getting my license was even easier , especially when I was the one who funded the board 's creation in the first place . I 'm not very good , but that 's why I always have a couple surgeons standing around ready to go . I now get to murder many someones , in every state , every month . Sure , it may not be murder as far as our legal system goes . The women whose babies I abort actually invite me in and shake my hand afterward , thanking me . But the Justicars who police my ever growing capital have n't adjusted with the times and abortion is still technically murder . The kicker ? They 're also bound by the laws of the land and ca n't execute me on the spot because what I 'm doing is perfectly legal and they are lawful to a T. I do the crime all the time by their rules but never have to do the time by our rules because even when they catch me red-handed , I 'm not technically red-handed . <newline> <newline> It 's gotten to be really fun . I actually stuck my tongue out at a Justicar yesterday . The young woman asked what I was doing and I made up some pithy thing about sticking it to the imaginary man who wanted to hold her down and not let me do what I was doing . We laughed . It 's really gotten to be fun . I wonder how much more fun it 'll be when I get one of those women alone in a closet and strangle the life out of them ?

It was a test of the professor ’ s patience , and a trial of his intelligence , but he would try everything to get this man to understand . <newline> <newline> What had pained the professor was the fact that his long reports of the many possibility of the device , seemed to have been ignored .

Drying them , he moved over to the chair that Hilary Flint sat backwards on , his shirt torn free of his torso . All manner of scars and old wounds crisscrossed his back from the telltale pock mark of a grenade to the thin , almost invisible lines of a dagger . The doctor was a Man in his seventies at least , nearly as old as Faith was . His carefully beard had gone white , as had what little hair remained on his head . His hands , thought gnarled and twisted as oak , were calm and steady as he picked up a stainless steel forceps , and moved towards Flint . <newline> <newline> `` I wish I could say this is going to hurt me more than it will you , Captain , but let 's be real .

The doctor , not ungently , leaned over as he began to probe the wound , an ugly blackened thing weeping pus and blood . Flint hissed but kept silent , taking another swig of whiskey as the doctor poked and prodded . With one hand the doctor held the forceps , and with the other he wiped at the yellowish pus and infected blood with an easy air about him . <newline> <newline> `` Shot in the back . *Tsk , * *tsk* How could you let that happen ?

    "target": "Its been like this for years . The kill counters were granted to us by the gods . Each life was worth an objective ammount . This is XP . Levels require an ammount of xp equal to the previous levels ammount + 10 % . The starting ammount every person needs to reach level two is 1000xp . A common housefly is worth 1xp . We quickly figured out a way to tell whether a persons level was based in peace or war based on thier kill count compared to thier level . All kills due to natural causes/ natural disasters were attributed to the earth , its number was visible to all living things just by looking straight down . A constant reminder to remain humble , thats what my father taught me . He and my mother were military , and they drilled it into me that your level is not something to be proud of . `` It is n't a shame to you either . It is only what it is . A representation of survival , a tally marker of suffering . Be it yours or annothers . '' He stressed that there was no shame in ones level . He did this over and over . I was . Born level ten due to my mothers untimely death during childbirth . It wasnt unheard of for babies to be born two or three but for me to be ten was due to how much xp she had accrued during her own life . The level of a living thing alters the ammount it is worth in death . Father is an avid hunter and took me many times in order to alleviate some of my level issues . So i wouldnt have to explain to every new person i meet in life that my mothers death is mine to bear . On one trip i got to learn something special , the higher an animals level the further away you can see its level . We saw a number charging at us throught the trees , being 15 at the time all i saw was a skull , a warning to the lower leveled amongst us to be afraid of a hostile target . My father said it was seventy five . The number is too high for its fresh brown fur to hide , this bear was a manslayer . Never one to back down from a challenge i foolishly raised my rifle . As the shot i had lined up in my mind matched the one my eyes were showing me , the rifle was snatched up and away by my father . Swinging hard into the bears face with the butt of the gun he deftly moved in close with his bowie knife . It glowed in his hands , for anyone else this move was insane . For him it was as quick and easy to butcher that bear as it was to scratch his ass and yawn . He told me that day that every 100 levels youre granted an ability point , the high council frowned on using your abilities in public if they werent for healing . On the night i passed level 100 due to our hunting exploits i described the names of the abilities that were available to me . `` Decisive strike , the one he used to save me . An active class ability available to those who have at least one human kill . '' An inheritance my mother left me i suppose. `` healing light , a mid ranged ability available to be gifted to non-100 persons with no human kills . '' I had seen doctors use that all the time . It took me several minutes to get through the list . At the very bottom one stood out . `` Unique Passive : Blessing of the World '' as i read the words my father turned white . `` What could that even mean ? ? Is there a description alongside it ? '' `` No . '' i replied . `` We have to consult the high council on this one , get in the car . '' `` Sure ... '' I said as i brought up the menu behind my back . As he made it out the front door i selected and confirmed it . Nothing happened , and still it remained there on my stats `` Unique Passive : Blessing of the World . '' During the car ride the radio cut to the news : `` As many of have seen the counter we know to be owned by the earth itself has dissapeared . We are unsure what this means for the future . '' `` To begin with the high council has released statements assuring us that the world is not dead nor can it ever die as it was never alive to begin with . '' As we stood out onto the steps of the capital building the concrete shattered beneath me . I fell only for a moment . A hand reached up to cushion me . Rising from the hole in the ground my new acquaintance and i were met immediately by more guards than you would think could fit in the capital building . Behind the fearful agitated crowd i locked eyes with the leader of the high council . He wasnt afraid . The earth and stone golem turned to me and opened its mouth . To anyone but me it was only the sound of rumbling stone . What i heard it say was as astounding to me as it was to anyone who i would go on to tell : `` You have been chosen as my successor , all that was once mine is now yours , all that will be yours will be that of the earth .

Most of his former friends prefered to hang out with their childhood friends , or built a family . It did n't help that Jones was too greedy to party . He knew that after the third drink he would start liking it , start dancing and regret about it weeks later when he needed the money . The Irish pub was the same that he used to frequent back in the days . He went early to secure a seat before the liveband started playing . Whiskey on the rocks was his choice to start the evening . Beer would have made him tired too early and whiskey had more character and flair , that made him wade through his memories with a smile . From time to time he chuckled to himself as he remembered the pensioneer who partied harder than the young folks , or how he clogged the toilet at his former workplace by trying to flush down his stained underwear after a long night out . <newline> <newline> `` May I give you some company , Jones ?

Turning it around did n't have the desirect effect as it ignored every law of physics . The kid in him wanted to know what happened if he drops it , but he figured that it was n't time for jokes like that . He thought about the last years and the future . About all the jobs that he did and how much he detested working and not having a choice because of the stupid money . About how it would go on until the last tiny grain passed through . The hourglass hypnotized him . The grains fell and fell unstoppable like a waterfall . `` That 's how it is . '' He mumbled to himself until the hourglass stopped with one grain left . <newline> He did n't have to look up and accepted before the stranger could ask him . The same moment that the man stood up , buttoning his overcoat the hourglass vanished . Jones had a hard time following Death 's lackey to the exit , who was n't bothered by all the people and just walked through them . `` I do n't want to be rude , but what 's your name ? '' Jones asked . <newline> `` I am sorry , I forgot that you people use names . My name is Athanasius . Jump on . We should n't keep him waiting . '' <newline> <newline> Jones never saw a white horse before . It felt like silk and was whiter than his freshly painted livingroom , as if it was immune to dust . It was strong , elegant and smooth at the same time . _Whoever designed that horse has a lot of style._ <newline> He jumped on and off they went . The horse did n't move though . The room around them moved . It was creepy and fascinating at the same time . There was not a sound or a move . The place they had just been seemed so far away until it transcended into complete darkness and a new place appeared around them again . <newline> <newline> ______________________________ <newline> <newline> There is a book about a plot like this from Terry pratchett . It was part of the Death trilogy . I do n't remember the name though . You should definitely check it out . It 's worth a read ! <newline>"

The altimeter continue to spin as the craft rose higher and higher into the atmosphere . <newline> <newline> Then ... the roar of the engine ceased . The click of the lights slowed , and the silence began to creep in . Major Tom 's hands rose from his lap and floated in the zero gravity . Earth lay behind him , and eternity lay before him .

If you dare . '' <newline> <newline> Major Tom looked to the circular hatches at the rear of the cockpit . Through the hatch window he could see the rounded horizon of earth and the total darkness showing beyond . He opened the first hatch and closed it behind him , only one piece of metal door separated him from the vacuum of space . He secured the tether to his harness and attached the air his to his pack . The hiss of oxygen greeted him and stabilized ; there were no leaks . <newline> <newline> He opened the hatch and eternity opened before him . He keyed his radio . <newline> <newline> `` Major Tom to Ground Control . I 'm stepping through the door . And I 'm floating in a most peculiar way .

Around him the stars shined brighter than anyone had ever seen . `` And the stars look very different today .

Planet Earth is blue , and there 's nothing I can do . '' <newline> <newline> He reeled back into the ship and sealed the hatch .

Soon , it too was receding behind as his vessel left earth orbit . <newline> <newline> He calmed his breathing as he looked forward into the brilliant sky ablaze with distant stars . He keyed the radio and spoke once more . <newline> <newline> `` Major Tom to Ground Control . '' There was mostly static , but Ground Control sounded from a distance . `` Go ahead , Tom .

At first , it was the most interesting scientific phenomenon , at least that 's what they say . It seemed that , at random time intervals , some babies would just freeze . No , they were n't dead , they just did n't move . No breath , no flinching . As if they were statues of wax , and not made of flesh and bones . And in matter of few years , it spread to toddlers and older kids as well . <newline> <newline> <newline> As the days went by , the occurrences grew in number and popularity . It became number one story in the media . People were talking about it everywhere . Sometimes , I look up the articles of that time , the time before I was even born . How simple it must have been ! Not having to see statues of humans all the time around you . I look at the video recordings from the earlier time . They are the only movements I have seen around . <newline> <newline> <newline> Some called it will of God , and some called it trick of Satan . People came together to pray . Governments came together to talk . Scientists came together to experiment . No one could stop it . Then some wise man in white coat somewhere figured out that it happened to all those who were born after a certain date . In hindsight , it was pretty obvious . One of the biggest attempt of mankind to understand time and space had created a situation with hundreds of more questions . <newline> <newline> <newline> Governments urged the youngsters not to use it . But they were young ! And it was n't like they could catch everyone who tried it . I still remember the reports I read about the mass executions in the Middle East . They were n't the only ones to enforce the law against these young Time-Stoppers . <newline> <newline> <newline> And the chaos continued . There was no way to turn it around . Everyone who was born now had the power . Power to freeze the life of everyone who had every used the power . Whenever someone was seen frozen , they called the special men in black uniform . They would come in their big van with the sirens and execute the frozen person right there and then . I guess they wanted to get people scared about it . But it was n't really under anyone 's control . When it comes to human brain , there is always entanglement of emotions . The trigger was different for everyone . The most common trigger was anger . Someone pissed you off , you ca n't control it and bang ! Now you are one of them . No matter for how small amount of time you used it for , no matter whether you wanted to or not , you did it . And now you were one of them . They say the government had locked up some of them and would torture them everyday till they would agree to freeze time for half an hour . And that 's when the black men in uniform used to crawl through the streets . No property was private , no house was a home . They were everywhere and they were merciless . I still remember the video that spread through the social media before everything broke down . It was just another execution in the street , but this time , the guy woke up just before the execution and tried to get away . But they had to finish the job . I still remember it all , his vain attempts to run , his frantic pleading , him clutching his family photo to the chest and closing of eyes . And then blood . So much of it . I think that 's when people started losing hope . And so did my dad . <newline> <newline> <newline> My mom was crying one day and she did n't return home the next day . That 's all I remember . My father sobbing . He told me that she was in a better place . I did n't know what that meant then . Must have been somewhere far , somewhere time was still our friend . But my dad taught me how to control myself , how not to lose focus . <newline> <newline> <newline> So of course the Time-Stoppers revolted . Some say it was started by the ones who escaped from the government . The reports of missing people and dead bodies found everywhere . It all broke down . <newline> <newline> <newline> That was three years ago . I still have n't used my power . When it was going on , my dad told me that he was going out for getting food and never came back . Later I found his frozen body covered in blood . It took all I had not to use my power . I started looking for ones like me , who had never used it . I found some , but one way or another , they all lost it . <newline> <newline> <newline> Now all I see is statues of humans . I have n't seen a moving human for two and a half years . At first I thought that they would move after a few days . That was the maximum amount of time that one person could freeze it for .

I walked downstairs where my mom was frantically getting breakfast ready . <newline> <newline> My little snot of a younger brother was tearing pieces of toast apart and throwing them on the ground when Mom was n't looking . He hated toast , but it looked like Mom had stayed up most of last night and woke up late this morning , meaning toast was on the menu . I bent down and picked up the pieces , putting it back on his plate . He was only six , but that did n't phase me . <newline> <newline> `` Now you have to eat it after it 's been on the floor . Stop making life hard for Mom . '' I said . <newline> <newline> `` Haley ! '' Mom scolded , grabbing the plate away from Gavin . She gave another piece of toast to him , and he swore up and down he would n't do it again . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't give your brother dirty food . I did n't get the floor cleaned last night . I was pretty busy . '' Mom said , running her hand through her hair . She grabbed her coffee mug and took a few sips . <newline> <newline> `` Busy doing what ? '' I asked . She fell silent . Whatever it was , she did n't dare say it in front of Gavin , so I decided to drop it . <newline> <newline> Dad was coming over today to take us both to school . I had n't seen him in a few months . Mom won custody , and ever since , I only saw him during school breaks . Spring break was just around the corner , and since today was the last day , he was in charge of taking us to school that morning . <newline> <newline> A piece of toast came flying in my direction , and I just barely dodged it . <newline> <newline> `` Gavin , you little- '' the doorbell rang . <newline> <newline> Dad was standing at the door . He looked like he had n't slept in days . His eyes were red and his shirt looked dirty . When I opened the door , he gave me a half smile . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , Haley . '' He said that quietly . He looked at me sympathetically . Not that I do n't love my dad , but it was a little weird the way he was acting towards me . My mom came to the front door to greet him , something she never does . She handed him an envelope . <newline> <newline> `` You have everything that 's needed ? '' She asked . She looked like she was about to cry . I 'm not sure what the hell happened between the two of them , but it was starting to freak me out . Dad nodded , and asked to come in . My mom said yes . <newline> <newline> It was weird for my mom and dad to be in the same room and not argue . They were perfectly quiet and civil towards each other , and I had a slight fear that they may have caught me doing something . I searched in my memory anything that they would want to punish me for , and came up with nothing , which only made me more anxious . <newline> <newline> My mom put my plate in front of me . Eggs and toast . I loved my mom 's cooking , so I felt bad not eating it . <newline> <newline> My mom seemed overly joyed to eat her food , as did my dad . They both started talking about how great breakfast was , and about how I should try it . <newline> <newline> I always got so angry when people talked about food and how good it was , and lately my mom has been pushing me to eat it . I knew how good it was , I just did n't want to eat it . You 'd think they 'd stop after a while , but the requests kept getting worse . My mom would go through hoops to try to make me eat , including taking me to fancy restaurants and cooking my favorite meals . It seemed as though every time I did n't want to eat , she 'd try shoving it down my throat , and I 'd get sick . No wonder I was fat . <newline> <newline> After breakfast , I grabbed my backpack and walked to dad 's car . He came around to the front and started the car . <newline> <newline> `` Where 's Gavin ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> `` He 's not coming , '' Dad said . `` He said he felt sick . '' <newline> <newline> `` And of course Mom fell for it , '' I sighed . `` She always does . '' <newline> <newline> He"

It was all he could do to ignore his heavy wheezing , wet and rattling at this point from the two miles it took to get to Anderson ’ s . The day was bright and hot , the air crisp and clean ; a perfect June morning . Such a waste that it would be Miles ’ first day of summer work . <newline> <newline> And he was late . <newline> <newline> Down the street and left at the light sat a quaint and not very curious place of business . It looked much like any other with a dusty brown awning that read “ Anderson ’ s ” in elaborate but faded white letters . Behind the glass door sat a man at the front desk chewing an unlit pipe and reading the morning paper . He seemed unbothered by the lack of business and quite peaceful behind his thick rimmed glasses and under his bushy brow and wrinkles . Time was of least concern to him . <newline> <newline> The door swung open and the bells attached jangled angrily . The man did not look up to greet the boy but instead chuckled as he finished off a comic strip . Miles huffed and set his hands akimbo struggling to speak . But before he could get out a word the man spoke . <newline> <newline> “ Well , I suppose one should consider this a bad first impression hmm ? But I would be lying if I said I am surprised or even disappointed . You clearly did your best to get here and best was not enough . We ’ ll look past it today and see how tomorrow fares , hmm ? Come on then , let ’ s get started . We ’ ve wasted enough time. ” <newline> <newline> And with one surprisingly swift motion he had risen from his chair and strode through a door leading to a back room . Miles stood puzzled for a moment before cautiously following . <newline> <newline> The back room was far grander than Miles had anticipated . It reminded him of a study , or a library . The difference here being that instead of walls and shelves lined with books , they were stacked with shoes . <newline> <newline> Hundreds if not thousands of shoes . <newline> <newline> Some in boxes , some just single sided , all carefully separated and tagged . As Miles followed he glanced at the florescent green and orange tags . <newline> <newline> 8M RNG <newline> <newline> 8W ACCT <newline> <newline> 7W FLR <newline> <newline> He could make sense of the size , but the letters that followed remained a mystery to him . The man turned to face Miles suddenly . <newline> <newline> “ Tomorrow we ’ ll go through the more important details of your job . For now , I want you to do three things. ” <newline> <newline> Miles stared at him awaiting instructions . <newline> <newline> “ One , my name is Mr. Anderson . You will find that I am relaxed in most cases and understanding in even more cases than that . I do believe that a name , much like a label or title , is important . We will treat it with the value it deserves . Two , you will begin to sort each of the unpaired shoes into the four empty aisles on that side of the room. ” Back turned to Miles , the man lifted his hand lazily gesturing to a group of vacant rows. ” <newline> <newline> Then strolling towards the front of the shop once again Mr. Anderson turned to face Miles . He stopped for a moment and seemed lost in thought , running his fingers lightly up and down one of the shelves . <newline> <newline> “ Finally , for the moment , you are not to go through the room at the back of this one. ” <newline> <newline> His tone indicated that this was of utmost importance . And with that Mr. Anderson disappeared once again to the front of the shop leaving Miles to begin his first day at the cobbler ’ s . <newline> <newline> The work was boring , but it became almost relaxing over time . As Miles worked he would pause and probe the shoes . Some appeared to have been there for ages . Far longer than the typical one week repair time usually expected . Others seemed dated and forgotten by time , but certainly not forgotten by Mr. Anderson as their tags were fresh and without a crease . It was all a mystery to Miles why his father would have felt this a good “ lesson ” for him to learn this summer . For now though , Miles was content to have some change to enjoy on the evenings and weekends . Looking down at his own beaten tennis he noticed that part of the sole had ripped away from the body , possibly due to a combination of age and his earlier haste to get to the shop on at a reasonable hour . <newline> <newline> At around noon , Mr. Anderson stepped into the room and announced “ That ’ s fine . Come up front. ” Before turning on his heel and disappearing once again . Miles placed a single shoe on a shelf taking careful note of his progress before hurrying to the front . He had barely closed the storage room door before Mr. Anderson spoke . <newline> <newline> “ Take those shoes off . They ’ ll need some repair. ” <newline> <newline> Miles had barely noticed their state himself and had not noticed Mr. Anderson look at him for more than a brief moment so the statement caught him somewhat off"

It was as though the man killed my own blood kin . He certainly killed my best friend . He killed my only family . I lost it . I was n't thinking rationally . All I knew was that Mr. Kitty was gone . And if you saw the sick pleasure in that man 's eyes , you would have done something insane too . <newline> <newline> The way he smiled with all of his teeth showing .

I just know that sick man did n't deserve the happiness he got . Maybe I should have just seriously injured him instead of going all the way . Whatever . No one else will have to feel the pain that I did . At least , not from this man . I 'm not sorry for what I did . But I did n't take pleasure in doing it either . '' I sat there , tears streaming down my face reminiscing the sight of my mangled cat , waiting for my fate . <newline> <newline> I looked up and met eyes with the man 's wife . I looked around her , no kids . I looked back at her . She knew what her husband did . And she could tell how much it hurt me . I could also tell that she knew something was wrong with her husband . She just never admitted it to herself . She still sat tall with her curly blonde hair , caked in make up . She was living in a dream . I almost felt bad for her .

    "target": "( 1/2 ; I 'll post the 2nd part below ) <newline> <newline> I work the night shift . People on television call it the 'graveyard shift ' or 'third watch ' , but the 8pm-4am paramedic shift is unique to the night because all deaths have their patterns . The most common time to die of a heart attack is mid-morning , and more specifically on a Monday . The most common time for a slip-and-fall accident is 3pm on a Thursday . Spousal abuse is 6:30pm on a Friday if the victim lives , and 11:30pm Friday if the victim dies . And the most common time to die in a drunk-driving related crash is 2:45am Sunday morning . So my shift defines my patients , and I work nights . <newline> <newline> Certain things about working a night job are hypnotically calm . I walk to the 24hr grocery store at 4:15am , bypassing the empty lines as I stroll right up to check-out with my basket and get everything scanned in a flash by the lone clerk wearing the nametag 'Tim ' . Somehow I do n't think it 's his real name . I go home where my roommate Shane is stumbling back at the same time that I am , counting his cash from another day 's artificial flirting at the gay club where he tends bar . When he 's not around sometimes I go to the corner bar to play pool with the regular crowd of crackheads and tweaks still up at this time of night , descending on the only bar in town I know that 's open to nightcrawlers like me . Finally I sleep in a bedroom where I 've covered the window in tin foil so the sunlight does n't stream through and wake me up at 8 or 11am before I actually wake up at 3 . It 's not a lot of sleep , I admit . I rarely get to bed before 8am , which to 'normal ' people would be like a 9pm curfew , but I ca n't sleep much later without having a sense of shame at the wasted day ahead . I wake up , cook some 4pm breakfast , and go run a few sets of stadiums at the convention center as the sun starts to set over the pier . The African man and his wife are here again . They 're here at least three times a week , and while he 's in gym clothes she wears a full , colorful fabric garb and large headwrap , running up and down the stadium stairs as he encourages her in a language I do n't understand . They seem genuinely happy . It 's curious . <newline> <newline> I get to work shortly before 8pm and change into my uniform . I 'm still relatively new to nightshift and it 's nice to catch up with the noon-8pm crowd . Most car crashes ( non-drinking ) happen at 5:30pm . I 'm a whiz with the jaws of life . <newline> <newline> Today 's Friday , so the gears do n't really start up until the drunken fight calls and gang violence roll in after 9pm . You 'd think those calls would be later into the night once the bars are closing , but the gang neighborhood issues usually sprawl out earlier ; 9-10ish , while the bar fights are more towards 2 . Those are relatively easy because I 'm in a public environment so it 's really just a grab-and-go call ; get them in the rig and on our way . What 's stranger to me are the calls that invite you into the personal lives of others ; getting a 911 call to someone 's home and filling your head with the full context of where and how people live . You 're not just picking up a drug overdose patient . You 're picking up a drug overdose patient in a run-down house with rotting food in the cabinets , the thick , humid stench of waste in the bathroom , and a screaming toddler in soiled clothes reaching up from the make-shift playpen they 've been placed in hours before . We call Child Protective Services for the kid but we 'll never find out what happened . Not until someone calls 911 again . <newline> <newline> The highest statistical frequency for child abuse ( pre-K ) is around 1pm . I once went to the home of a man who duct-taped his four year old son 's arms together and burned him in the eye with a cigar . Apparently the kid was hyper and running , and the duct-tape/cigar combo was a lesson to stay put . I do n't have any nieces or nephews yet so I 'm not sure what the correct punishment is supposed to be . That call was early in my career , and I was pretty upset by what I saw . Whenever I have a particularly bad case we inevitably have to clean our ambulance afterwards , so I get a bit of time back at our station for decontamination and I used to spend a minute in the bathroom running the sink 's warm water over my hands . It was like an 'all clear ' sign to me , that I 've left the call , cleaned myself of it , and am back to normal . Warm water on your wrists is incredibly calming . Today I had three cases of spousal abuse , a few car crashes , bar fights , and a yard fire . One of the abuse cases was victim to a frying pan , which was a new method to see . When I finish work , I swing by the 24hr grocery , buy my stir-fry dinner from Nametag Tim , and go"

But take my word for it . Her meatloaf rocks . <newline> <newline> That 's why I wish we had gotten the news on a night when I was n't eating her delicious , home-cooked meatloaf . I was in the kitchen , at our dinky little coffee table-that-isn't-really-meant-for-meals in our dinky little house in Queens . I had my laptop open , propped up on one knee actually , and was browsing the web for information on the upcoming episode of Doctor Who .

She went very still , she did n't break down in great , dramatic sobs like you always see on soap operas . She just thanked the officer for his time , closed the door , and turned back to me . I was so much more scared by the look on her face than I 've ever been in my entire life . All the strength in her was just gone . <newline> <newline> `` Your Uncle is dead . '' She said . Just like that , plain and simple , like a slap to the face . My Aunt spoke with such confidence , even then , I thought maybe she was pulling a prank . <newline> <newline> `` How ? '' I said .

To who , I have no idea , since nobody can fucking read . Whatever . Let 's make this a letter to me . Dear me : remember when everyone went blind because of that stupid virus ? <newline> <newline> At first it was not so bad , people thought you had to eat at Chipotle to get it and all it did was make you puke and shit your brains out for a while . Then about a year later those same puke-and-shitters started going blind . That 's when people started to panic . Then Chipotle went out of business . Then people figured out it was n't even Chipotle to begin with . Something in the water supply . Too late . Everyone got it . <newline> <newline> Things slowed down real fast . Airports closed , then nobody was driving anywhere . People walking into stores and just taking food , what they could figure out was food . We saw our neighbor down at the corner shop trying to eat a bag of cat chow , not sure what she thought it was . That was before Mom went blind . <newline> <newline> Look , I did n't ask for any of this shit to happen . I mean nobody did , but all I wanted was to sit in my room playing Xbox like I 've always done . I do n't ask much out of life . Was n't popular in school and not smart enough for college . Things after high school smoothed out okay . Mom had her social security check to live on and we did okay . I spent most nights and afternoons sitting in my room playing Xbox on the 32-inch plasma I bought by saving up from my job at the corner shop . Then after the virus I did n't even have to go to work anymore which was fine by me , those people suck . And since I knew I 'd not be able to play games pretty soon , I stayed in my room and played . I wanted to finish Far Cry 6 , at least . <newline> <newline> And I did . So I started on the new Assassin 's Creed . And finished it . <newline> <newline> And I started Dark Souls 4 , which I 'd been putting off since last year . <newline> <newline> And I finished it . <newline> <newline> By then I knew something was happening . <newline> <newline> Or at least , something *wasn't* happening . <newline> <newline> Look , I 'm not a fucking asshole , I still made sure Mom had food every day , and I made sure the house was protected -- things started getting shitty outside by then . The clumsiest fucking gangs of raiders were roaming around by then , but they were easy to stay ahead of . A few boards over the windows , lock the doors , stay quiet . You know what it 's like to face off with a group of angry blind looters ? It 's fucking retarded easy . <newline> <newline> I think the only thing I really did wrong was I did n't tell Mom I could still see . <newline> <newline> I think she 's starting to suspect , though . She keeps feeling her way down the hallway to my room and hearing sounds from the game through the door . `` What 's that ? '' she yells . <newline> <newline> `` It 's just one of my games , '' I say back . `` I just put it on for noise , I like the sounds . '' <newline> <newline> `` VICTORY ! BOSS DEFEATED ! '' goes the game . I do n't think Mom knows what it means , but I think she 's starting to suspect . <newline> <newline> Something will change soon . I already went down to Best Buy and took all the games from the Xbox section . I 'll run out of new ones to play within another three months or so , they 're not making any more new ones .

    "target": "Gerald sat on his back porch , staring contentedly at his back yard , a glass of iced tea slowly warming in the late afternoon sun . No thoughts crossed his mind , at his age thoughts were n't a necessity and only showed up when something of import hove itself in front of him . Two minutes or two hours , it did n't matter how long he 'd sat there , he was enjoying the warmth , the sound of the light breeze , and not thinking . It was his favorite past time , aside from yelling at the TV . <newline> <newline> His reverie was shattered with the sound of a whistle and a heavy thunk from the yard . Thoughts now came into his mind unbidden and without so much as an invitation . Probably just some neighbor kid threw a football too hard , he thought , it 'll teach him a good lesson if he never gets it back . <newline> <newline> With the slow grace of semi-warm marmalade , he unfolded himself from his high-backed rocking chair , achieved something that vaguely resembled an upright posture , and descended the short stairs to the grass that he so lovingly maintained . If a single blade is out of place , he thought again , there will be hell to pay . <newline> <newline> An object sat in the middle of his yard , bits of dirt clung to it 's sides , and it steamed quietly to itself . As Gerald inched closer , he could see that it was no football , that it appeared to be a hunk of glass , about the size of a cantaloupe . It 's edges were sharp and showed signs of recent fracture , much the same way that old obsidian arrowheads do . Puzzled by this odd intrusion into his world , Gerald descended to his knees to examine it closer . He retrieved the ancient set of bifocals from his shirt pocket , wiping them with a corner of his handkerchief and placing them precariously on the end of his nose . <newline> <newline> What he beheld was no ordinary bit of melted silica and soda ash . From deep within the glass came a cyan color of incredible intensity yet no direct source of illumination or focal point . It was as if the glass itself radiated blue , yet there was no single source from which the blue came . Tentatively , Gerald reached out a gnarled hand , and touched the material . It was warm , warm like bread fresh out of the over , yet also mildly electric . Gerald withdrew his hand and pondered some more . A passing airplane , perhaps ? He craned his back as far as his advanced years would allow him to . <newline> <newline> Nothing up there . A passing bird , and a leaf on the wind . He watched it soar for a moment , before it passed out of sight . <newline> <newline> Just then , another whistle and thunk , this time of greater magnitude . A second piece , this one about the size of Gerald 's TV , now lay in the freshly tilled earth of his garden . It , too , steamed and radiated the same incredible sky-blue color . <newline> <newline> Sky blue . Another intrusive thought . <newline> <newline> Gerald scanned the skies again , this time seeing something . A blackness , a small piece of nothing up there above his head . His wizened face scrunched up in thought , now that he needed thoughts none decided to show up . Ungrateful thoughts , oughta be ashamed of themselves . <newline> <newline> As he stared into the black , he saw it suddenly grow bigger , and a glint move across the sky . The glint grew bigger and bigger , seeming to rush towards Gerald much like an old friend would , if Gerald had any old friends anymore . With a piercing shriek instead of a mild whistle , a much larger piece of glass plowed into the corner of Gerald 's porch , a great crashing boom that sent pieces of wood flying everywhere , dirt splattering across the sides of the modest house , and the glass of iced tea somewhere into the neighbor 's yard . Stunned and shocked , Gerald could not come up with any response other than to gape at what just happened . <newline> <newline> He turned and looked upward at that black spot . Now long , thin , creeping black arms appeared to radiate out of the spot , ever widening , branching , reconnecting , splintering anew . A memory clicked to life in Gerald 's mind , when he was 23 and went ice fishing with his father , and he got into an area where the ice was too thin . Watching the ice do the same thing , knowing that at any moment it would collapse and he would drown . The same fear of death he had then came to him now , his old heart racing with adrenaline , his hands shaking . A much larger piece now hurtled earthward , slamming with incredible force into his neighbors house , flattening it completely and knocking over the great old oak tree that had stood in front of the house for almost 200 years . Tears came from Gerald 's eyes . The sky , literally , was falling down around him ."

    "target": "Magick 's End marks the beginning of the end of magick . Seventy some odd hundred years ago , two of the most powerful mages took their hosts and clashed over the most inhospitable mountain range in the frozen south . Legend tells us that the two clashed so fiercely that a false sun hung in the sky through the night . That all the Divines ' descended from Cestel and stood watch around , powerless to intervene . Forced to stand aside as two men rent the universe to align with their conflicting wills . That Mysteria stood too close when Magick gave up reconciling with this world which is why she has n't been seen in the night sky since . Existence , with a dejected sigh that echoed round the world , simply stopped bothering with that place . <newline> <newline> Men like legends which put them above the Divines . The truth is , as near as anyone ever bothered to record , is that no one made it out of there to record what actually happened . History goes back and forth about which one of the two actually won ; both accounts had the same effect on the world making the whole thing completely pointless . <newline> <newline> In fact , the only reason people even bother to discuss that battle is Magick 's End . You have this perfectly fine and untouched mountain range , that even snowmen wear sweaters when visiting , abruptly interrupted by a cube where the land is just missing . Like a loose brick that fell out of a wall and crumbled on the land below . Its not like someone just set off a part of the mountain range by conjuring up the most ornery of volcanoes ; we have many mages who have done that in history and they 're not that remarkable . Something just came along and cut a space out of the fabric of the land and sewed in a discolored patch . <newline> <newline> Light bends around it as often as it will shine on it , revealing a smooth stone gray surface sunk into the ground . Sometimes that surface shatters with horrendous quakes ; other times it rolls and crashes like the ocean . I once saw the surface drip stony gray rain onto the ceiling above , which coalesced into jagged gray boulders that rained down , splashing more gray drops onto the the ceiling . Sometimes it is day in Magick 's End while the rest of the world rests in the night . Magical scholars , philosophers and clerics alike have pondered and guessed at the meaning of this place for those seventy some odd hundred years and they could conclude nothing . No , not that they could n't come up with anything ; that the meaning of the place was literally nothing . If anything I 've said of this place caught your attention , let it be this : The universe abandoned this place long ago , all the better if we do too ."

People pass me by on the beach , laughing , smiling , jumping , energized by the ocean and enthralled by the history of the place that they are in . <newline> <newline> I do not see the beauty of these homes , but the ghosts that linger on . Echoes of a time and place where man rebelled desperately against nature . Etchings and markings of a people that made a stand against the waters and lost . I can see the faded remains of trees , stripped away by storms and carved in memorial . These monuments are works of art , as ornate as they are beautiful . One in particular stands outside a house as old as the Island- or so it seems . Hundreds of birds , native to these lands , flow forth from a stump of a tree , each feather hand carved and carefully lain with the others . Beaks pointed in every which way , each bird following the others in a wave of nature forming into the fingery shadow of the old Oak that once stood in its place . It is a monument to nature . An apology . The final flight of the birds that once roamed these shores . <newline> <newline> This place is dying . I do not know why I have come to this place , desperate to feel some of that fancy I felt as a child . Some of the wonder and excitement of it . But now I see this place with clear and cynical eyes , starved of joy . The town is falling apart , the ocean itself stained a muddy brown . The only people happy are the tourists , wading through a world they neither understand nor care to . This is a place where people come to die , where they rest themselves in moldy homes , dreaming waterlogged dreams and wishing desperately to be free . Nothing is being built but docks and restaurants , more industry to pull whatever spare change visitors bring with them from their pockets . <newline> <newline> Plastic tables and frozen food are heaped upon me in every restaurant , shipped in from where the waters are n't poison and the fish do n't have three eyes . I long for that . The simple freedom of clean air clean water and happy fish jumping in the waves . <newline> <newline> But this place has a doom set upon it . A curse . <newline> <newline> And I fear I may never leave ."

He stood silently at the head of the metal-topped table for nearly a minute and a half as he waited for the rest of his former brothers in arms to get settled : Croc recklessly knocked over other chairs , Cobblepot had his bodyguard take his coat , and Two-Face conducted a lengthy seating decision process .

Not quite there yet._ <newline> I try being nice and helping when I can , we had a Christmas dinner together last year and I sometimes cook for them . It 's quite easy being a good neighbour when you get on well with each other . Maybe Jerry 's got a little crush on me , the-older-girl-next-door . Obviously I 'm too old for him , but I 'm sure that wo n't stop boys doing what boys do . <newline> On my way out the front door , I saw the silly christmas-cracker gifts on my coffee table . I counted a spinning top , a kazoo , and a metal-ring-attached-to-the-spring puzzle . <newline> _I should get rid of those , I 'll never use them . Maybe I 'll see if they want them._ <newline> I fitted them in one hand and started jogging up the stairs . I scuffed the toe of my new trainers on the metal staircase , sighed a little , and continued up . <newline> I rang the bell , and decided to do a little jogging on the spot . When no answer came after 20 or so seconds , I decided to just lodge them in the tiny letterbox . <newline> _Guess it was just my imagination . They are n't in after all._ <newline> There was only enough room for two of the three , so I stuck the kazoo in my mouth ( I figured that was the cleanest thing since it was supposed to go there ) and turned around to jog back down the stairs . <newline> As I looked down at my new trainers , I saw that one was still untied . The new-trainer-grip held on tightly to the laces of the other trainer , which I raised up too quickly , and I felt myself about to topple . <newline> <newline> `` Uh-oh '' I tried to say . <newline> `` Voop voop '' is what came out ."

    "target": "In the 17th century there was a man named Nicholas Molineux . Nicholas was from a rather lowly family and was a prodigy with the violin , but despite his amazing talent he could n't manage to make a name for himself in the world of music , due to the large numbers of talented violinists at the time . But he loved playing his violin so he kept at it . For years he played what gigs he could get , but never managed to catch the public eye . Then one day he was approached and asked to play for an opera . He accepted , learnt his music and showed up for rehearsals . It was there that he first saw Annalette . Annalette came from a very wealthy family , and was a wonderful singer but , despite her wealth and talent , she had a kind soul . Nicholas noticed this very quickly and fell for her almost as fast . After some courting he discovered that she too had feelings for him . the two fell deeply in love and Nicholas soon asked her father for his blessing to marry his daughter , and was promptly shot down . It was just no good for the daughter of such a wealthy family to marry one so poor . Nicholas told Annalette of her fathers answer and she began to cry . While wiping Annalettes tears Nicholas told her of his plan . He would head out and finally get recognized for his skills . he would then amass a fortune using his newfound fame so that he could get her fathers blessing . Depressed at the thought of her love leaving her for so long , but trusting him fully , Annalette agreed to the plan . So Nicholas headed out to make his way . He played everywhere he could . He saved every bit of money he earned but he was still getting nowhere . then one day , as he was playing , he was approached by Antonio Stradivari , the famed instrument crafter . Antonio had heard the passion with which Nicholas played his violin , and said he wanted to give Nicholas a violin worthy of such passion . Nicholas , flabbergasted , accepted this generous gift . Word spread of the violinist who had played so passionately that THE Stradivari had given him a Violin . Over night Nicholas got more fame than he had in all his life . Everybody wanted the passionate Nicholas Molineux to play for them . Before long Nicholas had ammased a small fortune and felt he could finally return and gain the blessing he had set out to acquire . Annalettes father said yes this time and Nicholas happily married Annalette . The World went crazy for the talented couple . They were the brad-gelina of their time . Pretty soon came the first baby . Nicholas Molineux II . Then a year later another , Annabeth Molineux . Then another year later twins , Edward and Edmund Molineux ! then a few years later the last was born . Geoffrey Molineux . At the age of 9 it was discovered that Nick the 2nd was a virtuoso on the trumpet . Then Annabeth , at the age of nine , was discovered to be a virtuoso celloist . The twins turned nine and were found to be virtuosos on the tuba and trombone . By this point everybody knows and loves the Molineux family . They traveled around and played as a family and sold out every show , so when the time came for Geoffrey to Turn 9 the world was abuzz . Everyone wanted to know what instrument the last child played . The big day is here , Geoffrey turns nine and he ca n't wait to find his instrument . Nicholas and Annalette take him to an Instrument shop and tell him to try everything . so he tries the trumpet , aaaand sucks at it . His parents encourage him to try another so he picks up a clarinet , and cant play it either . So it goes for the rest of the day , he tries everything from the clavier to the didgeridoo and sucks at every last one . In desperation Nicholas goes to Antonio and asks him to make a special woodblock for Geoffrey , a Stradivarius woodblock . Antonio agrees and begins to work . A month later Nicholas finally is able to give Geoffrey his new woodblock . Geoffrey loves it . He plays the thing every waking moment , and is extremely talented with it , at least as talented as one can be on woodblock , so Nicholas asks one of the top Composers of the time to write an overture . An overture for woodblock . He accepts and begins to work on it , meanwhile word has spread of the boys talent and the piece that 's being written for him . The big concert arrives . Its a stormy night but still the house is so packed that the coat closets are filled to the brim . It 's like heaven for a moth . Anyways , the concert begins . The crowd loves the piece and you can almost feel them rising and falling with the music . Then the time comes for the woodblock to finally be played . the music simmers down and then all becomes silent as Geoffrey pulls back his hand to play his woodblock . He brings down his mallet and it hits the Woodblock with a Sickening , awkward , and thoroughly unsatisfying , crack . Geoffrey looks down and see 's a crack down the middle of his cherished woodblock . a single tear rolls down his cheek and he then begins to sob . Pretty soon the orchestra begins to cry as well . then the"

That would make it all the better , y'see . Students would filter in to their American History class , bored , angsty , hopeless ... pencil-less . They 'd expect nothing short of , well , *nothing* from their new teacher . And then ... And *then ... * <newline> <newline> Oh , it made me giddy just to think about it . <newline> <newline> I slung my backpack onto the floor next to my chair and took a heavy seat .

Any minute . <newline> <newline> The first student , timid and short , crept in through the door . Obviously going to be the quiet smarty . He definitely would n't need my amazing , supernatural help . <newline> <newline> Next came a gaggle of preps , talking and laughing and gossiping loudly . They shot a glance at the quiet kid and giggled . Eventually , a steady stream of students was flowing in . God , there had to be at least forty kids in this class . One of them was *bound* to need my help . <newline> <newline> The late bell rang just as the last straggler stumbled in out of breath . I sat at my desk , hands clasped together calmly . This is it . This is the moment . <newline> <newline> `` So , class , '' I said , and the scattered whispers quieted immediately . `` This is American History . I would like you to pull out a sheet of paper and a pencil for notes . We will be diving right in . '' <newline> <newline> The loud shuffling of paper overtook the room for a few moments . The overhead projector warmed to life slowly as I pulled the notes up on my laptop . A few giggles sounded from the gossip girls , and I ignored them . <newline> <newline> `` I know you guys , '' I said slyly , trying to keep the excitement out of my voice . `` One of you probably forgot your pencil .

Huh , of all people , I thought he 'd be prepared . <newline> <newline> I smiled . `` Then , '' I said , holding my hand out towards the mass of students , `` I 'll make one for you . '' <newline> <newline> A pencil materialized in my outstretched hand , new and perfectly sharpened . An audible gasp rippled through the class . <newline> <newline> The quiet kid slowly , *slowly* stood up from his seat and walked to the front . His hand hovered over mine , unsure whether or not to take the pencil . He glanced up at me . <newline> <newline> `` Oh . '' I looked at the pencil in my hand pointedly . `` You would like two , would n't you ? Never hurts to be prepared . '' <newline> <newline> The class gasped again then began shouting in confused excitement . Another pencil had constructed itself from the aether . It lay in my hand right next to the first . It was perfect . Beautiful . *Useful . * My superpower was *useful . * <newline> <newline> `` Th-Thanks , '' he muttered , his eyes glued to the magical writing utensils .

'' Holy Paladin Derrick said , his hands high above his heads as he shouted to his Lord . He stood at the edge of the main road towards town , his silver armor glistening in the sunshine . Around him , a few patrons of the nearby city rode towards its great gates , ignoring the fallen Paladin . `` Take my sacrifice , and use the power it gives to smite your enemies ! '' <newline> <newline> Derrick took a few steps forward into the road , where a horsemen casually moved out of the way as he passed in front of him . He walked with his eyes shut , his hands at his side , and he took a step every few seconds . <newline> <newline> `` Oi ! Paladin , get out of the way . I 've got goods to trade . '' The horsemen said , his carriage of silk and cloth filled to the brim . <newline> <newline> `` A Paladin no longer , '' Derrick shouted , `` an acolyte of the Dark Lord Wazadin ! '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't care what you are ! Move . '' The horsemen hit the reigns and began to push past the Paladin . He was struck by the side of the carriage and pushed into the ground . His silver armor now being covered with the dirt and mud of the ground . <newline> <newline> Derrick grunted as he pushed himself off the ground . He wiped the mud off the center of his chestplate and threw it onto the ground . `` Wazadin will punish the infidels such as you ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Sure he will ! '' <newline> <newline> Derrick wiped his hands off on the cloth hanging from his side . He used it to clean the rest of his chestplate off . An ordinary Paladin would have a sigil of a flaming sword , instead , Derrick 's plate had a sigil ( of which he painted on himself ) of Wazadin 's symbol , a red nine-pointed star . <newline> <newline> Once his chestplate was cleaned , he looked at the cloth in his hand . It was now muddy and worthless . He grinned , `` Great Wazadin ! Take this sacrifice of destruction and hate and give power to your Acolytes ! '' Derrick threw the cloth on the ground , and for the first time in his life , he *littered* . He smiled a big smile as he started to walk towards the city , intent on spreading his evil ways into the heart of the Holy Paladins . <newline> <newline> The trek was a short one , in which he shoved and pushed passed other patrons , each time shouting nonsense about Wazadin and being his acolyte . It was n't long before people were shouting at the Paladin , telling him to learn his manners and be a holy man . He laughed at each of them , and by the time he reached the gates , people had already heard about the `` arsehole Paladin . '' <newline> <newline> `` Derrick ! '' A voice yelled from within city . He looked around , trying to find the source of the voice . `` Is that you ? '' A hand slapped his shoulder and he turned to face the man . In front of him , was another Paladin , his flaming sword sigil still glowing strong on his place . It was one of his old friends , Trent , and the man who trained him . `` I thought you were dead ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Dead I was ! '' He shouted , `` But the great Lord Wazadin returned me to this land . To spread his voice . '' <newline> <newline> Trent laughed . `` Wazadin ! Oi , that 's a funny joke D ! '' <newline> <newline> `` A joke ? '' Derrick hit his chestplate , smearing some of the paint off . `` It is no joke . The Paladins left me for dead and the Dark Lord rose me to fight his fight ! '' <newline> <newline> Trent looked around , seeing the people stare at Derrick and spit on the ground . In an instant , it clicked . `` Wait , you 're the one these people are talking about ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I see my reign of terror is spreading !

'' <newline> <newline> Trent did n't waste any time , he pulled his sword from his sheath and shook his head . `` I am sorry D , you know the rules .

Before his hair grew white and his skin grew slack , the scars of battle fading with the relentless march of time . <newline> <newline> Still , Erik did not fear death . He knew it would bring him to Valhalla , and now , at the moment of his passing , he smiled as his final breath rattled from his body . Then all was light and ether . <newline> <newline> Erik awoke , if it could be called that . I truth , it was to normal waking what normal waking was to sleep . His senses sang in terrible harmony , his mind filled with a degree of perception greater than any he had ever imagined . He clutched at his head , his eyes bulging , slack jawed , his thoughts crushed by the overwhelming force of all eternity bearing down on him . <newline> <newline> Erik knew only one thing in that moment : He had never bowed to any foe , and if that foe was the cosmos itself , he would face it standing . <newline> <newline> With a scream of effort , Erik martialled his body . His legs . He needed his legs . He managed to roll onto his knees and plant one foot . Every moment of time , both past and yet to come , was howling around his ears in a silent maelstrom , colours undreamt of by human eyes danced like flames before him . <newline> <newline> With a grunt , Erik Svensson , breaker of bones , stood up . <newline> <newline> The madness stopped . The kaleidoscopic colours froze in place and faded , the whirling aeons paused , and Erik became aware of grass under his feet . He looked down and noticed for the first time that his body was as it had been in his prime , hard and strong . He looked up and found himself in a misty field , alone . There was an eerie silence , and a sense of dreadful stillness . There was no mistaking that this , indeed , was death . <newline> <newline> “ You are worthy. ” <newline> <newline> Erik whirled to face the voice behind him . He had been sure that there was nobody nearby , and his instincts were keen , yet a black-robed stranger stood behind him . The stranger ’ s robes were not of conventional material , coloured black . He seemed , rather , to be dressed in the utter absence of light itself . His face was mostly hidden , save for a lined and ancient jaw and eyes , deep in the darkness of his hood , that burned like coals . <newline> <newline> “ Who are you , stranger ? ” Erik demanded . The robed figure ignored his question . “ You are worthy , Erik Bonebreaker. ” The figure raised his voice and it echoed through the fog . “ A thousand thousand men have come before you , and been broken when faced with eternity . Only the strongest have the will to stand and fight in the face of the cosmos . You are one of the few , and have earned your place . Behold ! ” The figure raised his arms and the mists parted behind him to reveal an immense golden building . “ You may enter the Hall of Sacred Armament , that you might find the weapon that will lead you to your next quest… ” <newline> <newline> Before Erik could respond , the robed figure melted away like the mist and was gone . Erik looked at the huge building before him and began to climb the stairs . The doors at the top were made of iron and he heaved all of his mighty weight against them before they would swing silently inwards . Few mortal men would have the strength to enter such a place , Erik knew . <newline> <newline> Before him , the building was one enormous hall beneath a glass skylight , lined with weapons of every imaginable form . Some were affixed to the walls , others sat on oak tables , some were large enough to stand alone . Erik strode among their ranks , feeling something in his soul pulling him deeper into the hall . He paused at a gleaming hammer and knew in his heart that it was the legendary Mjolnir . Even Erik did not dare to touch it . To try to lift the Hammer of Thor was blasphemy . <newline> <newline> Elsewhere he saw many swords , some recognisable , others with strange , heathen shapes . There were clubs and cudgels , maces and morningstars , here and there strange metal tubes that he could not understand . He picked one up , experimentally . The tube seemed hollow , which would make it weak , and one end of it was of dark , polished wood . Clearly , a relic of some stupid and primitive people , Erik thought . A sensible weapon would have been the reverse ; a long wooden handle and the iron at the far end , the better to crush a skull with . <newline> <newline> He pressed on , unknown instinct drawing him towards a prize he had not yet found . He finally laid eyes on a table and knew , somehow , that this was what he sought , yet when he reached it , the table was bare . Erik"

After being selected for the program , during my first time in the lift-off simulator , or as we like to call it , the `` L.O.S '' , my lack of a buckled seat-belt resulted in my face being smashed into the tempered quartz-glass window .

Easy like that . <newline> <newline> In the department the decision to take on someone new for the job was controversial . But outside NASA , the media Ate.It.Up . The headlines raved about it . Instead of the next American Idol , people were looking to see who would be America 's next top astronaut . The auditions themselves were held in sunny , Orlando , Florida . Not too far from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral . Hundreds flocked but I guess it helped that I got there early .

Who does n't love an underdog , right ? It 's like I could hide it when my occupation would read across the screen `` unemployed '' every time I went on Good Morning America , fuck you good morning America . <newline> <newline> But what set me apart from the competition is that I wanted it bad . Not that other people did n't , but what they were unprepared for is that I had been waiting for my 15 minutes for YEARS . I remember living out in L.A. and using the money I had to ask my parents for to pay rent . I remember eating cereal twice a day just to survive . All in the hopes that I would `` make it '' as a film maker . I did n't even need a career . I just needed SOMEthing . One piece , one big success and I could die happy , just to say I did it , that I really did it . I loved film so much , if I went my whole life without making one successful movie then I felt like I was a waste of a heartbeat . I would have starved for a big break . Not that I already was n't . I considered filming my decay for YouTube and uploading it . `` Man starves himself for 5 months '' , I could see it on the front page now . 15 million views , getting asked to speak on local news TV ... And I would do it too , oh I swear to God I would do it if only it did n't violate YouTube 's terms of services . Otherwise like most things in my life then , it would be for nothing ... I wonder why God would give me such a strong desire for film making but make me a fuck up . I used to tell myself the feeling was him right beside me ! Telling me not to give up ! But it 's hard to believe that after driving 5 days on gas you ca n't afford to make it back to your parent 's house because you ran out of money after 5 months in L.A even though you saved for a whole year working day and night as a waiter . <newline> <newline> However , regardless of my past , this was my time to shine . The largest audience I ever had at a screening was 58 . I counted . Now , this time around , the whole world would be watching . Mom and dad were so proud , my girlfriend Samantha was so proud . Everyone was happy that I finally found something to do with my life , like film was me trying to fit myself , a square , into a round hole per say . I might not have been good enough to get a real job , or `` make it '' , but let me tell you , I 'm not dumb . I was always a good student . Not a great student but a good one . In fact I was pretty good at maths and sciences , and that 's what got me here . I was in shape , I could do the monkey-work of calculating this and that ... and I knew"

With that in mind , I decided I would start small . I bought a composition notebook and a pack of pens and on the first page , wrote a small statement . <newline> <newline> `` I wo n't ever get a job . '' <newline> <newline> By the end of the day , I was employed at a fast food restaurant and I knew what I had to do . <newline> <newline> The wishes started small , but then I realized I did n't have to write them down . I could change people 's lives simply by talking to them and saying the exact opposite of what I wanted , and that thing would then occur . It made me look like an asshole , but I did n't really care . I stopped caring what people thought of me a long time before then . <newline> <newline> I sit silently , watching the lights of Los Angeles twinkle beneath the penthouse apartment I told someone that I would never win . I smirk , sipping champagne from a crystal flute . <newline> <newline> It takes practice not to say anything positive- otherwise , bad things will happen . However , I 'm a naturally cynical person . This lifestyle comes naturally to me . My blog got started a few years ago and is now attaining millions of hits a day as I openly predict war , the end of civilization , and rave about how the President is going to kill us all . Most follow me for my obvious maniacal ranting . I do n't think any of them know that it 's just me standing between my words being empty and those events actually occurring . <newline> <newline> `` Sir . '' <newline> <newline> `` Will ? '' I say , without looking back . <newline> <newline> `` No , it 's Jack . '' My butler says with a chuckle . Will is my father 's name . <newline> <newline> `` What is it ? '' I turn to face him . <newline> <newline> `` There 's been a terrorist attack in Europe . They say the culprits have already escaped . '' <newline> <newline> Without speaking , I walk back into my house , following the patterns of tiles on the floor into a large room paneled with televisions . Each one is playing scenes from the attack , each anchor mouthing silently . <newline> <newline> I smile . <newline> <newline> `` They 'll never find him . '' <newline> <newline> My words echo , and I feel suddenly cold as the windows on the sides of the room fly open and then shut . I wait . <newline> <newline> The images on the screens change . The culprits are being forced into the back of a police van . <newline> <newline> `` Jack , my laptop is n't behind me , is it ? '' I say . Turning , I pull my laptop off the desk behind me and open it . I allow Jack to type in my password ( I always put in the wrong one ) and open it to my blog . I title the post `` Terrorist Attack One : More are Coming . '' <newline> <newline> `` Can I bring you anything ? '' My butler says . I shake my head with a laugh , and allow the room to fade away as I begin to write another false prophecy ."

    "target": "If eternal life and invincibility were the boons of immortality , boredom was the curse . Or at least one of the curses . Kara had learned that lesson well over the course of a century or two . She was still perfectly healthy , as perfect as she ’ d always been , but the flame of life had begun to sputter . So she ’ d made a promise to herself to try something new every day . And today ’ s agenda was murder . <newline> <newline> Kara stalked through city streets lit by a half moon . The knife sheathed at her waist felt odd and heavy . Of course she had ample experience with weapons thanks to her longevity , but modern society lessened the need to carry personal arms all the time . She ’ d considered using a gun , but then she figured it ’ d be more meaningful to do the deed up close . <newline> <newline> Another woman , tall with fire red hair , was walking alone a few blocks down . A perfect target . As she walked toward the woman , Kara wondered if she could really do this . Really take another life in cold blood . She thought her heart would be racing , but the rhythm in her chest remained as calm as it had been for the past few decades . Her previous daily ventures hadn ’ t affected it much either . All she wanted was to feel a rush . Some excitement . But was she ready to literally kill for it ? <newline> <newline> As Kara closed in , the redhead turned to look at her . The lone woman gave Kara a suspicious look and quickened her pace . The immortal kept her eyes locked on her target ’ s back . She rested a hand on her weapon and listened for her heart . No change . Would it ever kick in ? <newline> <newline> Another shape strode of out of the darkness . A figure in a heavy jacket . As two more figures joined the newcomer , the redhead stopped in her tracks . Hesitating for a few seconds more , she tried to cross the street . <newline> <newline> “ Hey , where you going , miss ? ” said one of the men . The woman broke into a run . One of the men shouted for them to give chase . They complied and quickly caught up to the woman , who had to stop to kick off her heels . Kara sighed . The day was almost over . She should really find a new target if she wanted to get this done . But…something stopped her from leaving . Something spurred Kara to follow . <newline> <newline> The three attackers had the target cornered in an alleyway . “ Don ’ t get the wrong idea , miss , ” one of them growled . “ We ain ’ t gon na rob you or do anything dirty . But some high-paying folks want you dead . Says your work is causing a lot of trouble for them. ” <newline> <newline> “ Please , I ’ ll do anything you want . I-I ’ ll stop ! Just let me go ! ” <newline> <newline> “ No , no no no . We can ’ t do that . We got ta send a message , you know ? Plus , we got orders. ” <newline> <newline> Kara had just stepped into the mouth of the alleyway . None of them had noticed her . With a sick grin , the lead one brandished a knife as the other two held the woman against the wall . Kara saw the look in his eyes . The dark , carnal bloodlust . Was that how she ’ d looked to the woman ? Was that who she wanted to be ? She felt at the cold steel of the blade that she didn ’ t even remember unsheathing . <newline> <newline> “ No… ” she answered herself aloud . Too loud . The four people in the alleyway turned to look at her . <newline> <newline> “ Mind you own business ! ” one of the men spat . <newline> <newline> “ No ! ” she repeated . “ Let her go ! ” Was she imagining it , or had her heart quickened ? <newline> <newline> “ Or what ? ” <newline> <newline> Without another word , Kara flipped her knife , caught it by the blade and flung it with deft precision at the lead man . He screamed as it sank into his arm . His own knife clattered to the ground . Kara charged at the attackers . Another man brought out a pistol , leveled it at Kara and fired . She caught the bullet and tossed it aside , earning a stuttered curse from the gunman . The third tried to stand in her way , but she bowled through him without much trouble . As the gunman tried to grab her , she dodged and slammed the back of his head . He dropped , unconscious , onto the third man . Kara turned to the lead attacker . He was still clawing at the knife that she ’ d thrown . She strode up to him , grabbed him , and slammed him against the wall . “ If I ever see you pulling this kind of shit again , ” she said in a calm voice , “ well , I ’ m sure you can imagine. ” Kara gave him the smallest of grins as she threw him to the ground . The man staggered to his feet and fled . <newline> <newline> The red-haired woman eyed the two unconscious men as she sidled up to Kara . “ I…thank you so"

This is the only way to describe such a thing that is happening above us . Close to five billion people have been wiped away in this police action . in 2155 a fleet of ships appeared above every major city in the world in a blink of an eye . Every space agency around the globe had no incoming transmissions , No knowledge that anything was coming . Just a blink of an eye and thousands of ships appeared as if they were teleported to those exact coordinates . Then they just sat . All attempts of communication failed , Every attempt to access the ships via docking were rejected . We even attempted to cut our way through a hull of a ship . But none of our technology was even capable of even making a scratch in the hull of the ship . So we waited and waited until one day it finally happened . The doors opened a smaller vessel had lowered to the ground in New York city . The creature emerged from the vessel and everyone was in awe . For that the first time we meet an alien race they looked exactly like us . They were distinguishable differences though as they were an average of two feet taller , No hair , extended ears , and no clothing . The news coverage said something about how they were called the `` architects '' and how they were hear to protect us from an incoming threat . This put the worlds armies in a code red status . I remember this like it was yesterday . For once the worlds entire population was in peace . Every other matter that has ever encumbered mankind was no longer relevant . Some three weeks later another fleet of ships had arrived . But they were much different then the architects fleet . They made no attempt to communicate with us because as soon as they arrived . The battle had begun the architects and the unknowns had began fighting . Huge ships the size of cities being destroyed , Crumbling cities below them . Its now been less then a year since this happened . I have nothing left , The world has nothing left . We have been reduced to nothing . All in the name of protection . Some speculate that the two alien invaders were at war with one another and each thought they were attempting to take a planet with intelligent beings . As if they were having some giant conquest to establish dominance over planets as we humans did at the beginning of our existence . All that matters now is that our planet is destroyed and our very existence is in danger . All in the name of protection . <newline> <newline> I hope i get to write again tomorrow .

Toby was getting agitated now - the Feline Federation were making preposterous demands . ''Dogs have been hunting with humans for thousands of years , providing food and companionship . It 's only fair that , as humans chosen best friend , dogs should inherit the Earth . It just makes sense '' , the grumpy Basset Hound continued . <newline> <newline> ''And what makes you think you have the ability to handle it ? '' , purred Mr Fluffles , president of the Feline Federation . He was a sinister looking Siamese , holding court from his Executive Play Tower © . Cardboard boxes were piled around him , holding the supreme Feline council , smugness emanating from their finely cleaned fur like a gas leak . <newline> <newline> The dogs howled in anger . ''Just look at us , noble creatures with brains considerably bigger than your largest , diabetic mouser '' . Toby snorted with derision . '' The idea that you could do anything better than us is simply ridiculous . You have one day to leave the court before our Mastiffs will be forced to evict you '' . <newline> <newline> Fluffles rose to his full height now , a full two feet above the carpeted platform . Fore paws hanging in front of him , Fluffles cleared his throat . ''My dear Toby , you 're right - dogs have hunted with humans , and protected their children , and defended their homes . Noble creatures indeed . But what did you get in return ? Table scraps , a kennel ? A nice short lead ? We felines have been using humans since the end of the ice age . The ancient Egyptians worshiped us ! All we had to do was lay down in their homes , and just like that - warmth , the finest foods , an abundance of toys , just for us '' . <newline> <newline> ''We used the humans , Toby , and they used you . We are your masters '' ."

From where , we do not know . I was just a boy when it left . I spent years wondering if we would ever find anything and what wonders we would discover upon its return . I have always been fascinated by the wonders that lied beyond the bounds of our Earth . My bookshelves are lined with books on astronomy , extraterrestrial conspiracies , etc . and my computer is bookmarked with several websites on the topic of aliens . I 've always been enamored by the unknown . What secrets does it hold ? Today was the day . Voyager was sent back to Earth with a message . The world would soon learn of the first contact made by life beyond our planet . I tuned in to the live broadcast made by the president for the reveal . <newline> <newline> `` After 37 years of waiting , the day has finally come . The mystery of what lies beyond or atmosphere will soon be a bit clearer . Brace yourself for what we are about to witness . '' <newline> <newline> The world was silent . This was perhaps the most momentous discovery in human history . I held my breath as President Obama began the video feed . After a few seconds of static , the video began with the familiar words `` ... Never gon na give you up , never gon na let you down , never gon na run around and desert you ... '' That was the last we heard from the unknown species ."
