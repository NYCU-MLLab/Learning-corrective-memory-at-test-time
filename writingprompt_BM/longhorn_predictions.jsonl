{"question": "The entire world loses all its WiFi , except for one place . Your body is the only WiFi hot-spot on the planet .", "answer": "It just happened one night . I woke up at 7 to get ready for work just like any other day . I checked my emails , no new one since I checked the night before . I hope in the shower , listen to Pandora , and head to the kitchen to eat some breakfast . I head out to my car to head to work when I start to notice something different . <newline> <newline> One of my neighbors was standing outside his car , looking puzzled at a map spread across the hood of his car . I start to drive to work , and see a few cars pulled over with more people looking at maps . I checked my phone to see if I have any emails again , however there still was none . This was extremely odd as I know my colleagues get in a hour before me to straighten out any issues that arose overnight , which they were supposed to send me an update 15 minutes ago . <newline> <newline> I pull into my parking spot and notice a few empty spots near me . I walk into the office , but I see complete chaos . The receptionist is running across offices , the IT team is working on the main computers , mainly the ones directly attached to the internet . I walk up to Red , our head IT , and ask him what is going on ? <newline> <newline> Red looks up at me when he answers , `` Internet 's been down all morning . We are trying to get it back on . '' He looks back down at the computer and exclaims , `` Hey guys , I have internet over here ! '' <newline> <newline> Half the office comes running to Red , almost knocking him over to get access to the internet . I back away , heading over to my office on the other side of the building . `` No ! It 's already gone ! '' I hear from behind me . <newline> <newline> I get to my desk and see that my internet is working fine . I send a few emails from yesterday that I never got to , and let my assistant , Carol , know that if she needs to use the internet , it seems to be working in my office . She walks in with her laptop and is shocked by that fact . `` The internet is down everywhere , '' Carol says , `` I almost did n't get to work on time today because my normal alarm clock is on my computer through the internet . Thank goodness my husband still believes in analog clocks to wake him up , or else I would be in the same boat as everyone that is n't here yet . '' <newline> <newline> '' That 's really weird , '' I say , scratching my chin . `` I had internet all morning . '' <newline> <newline> '' Maybe you 're just lucky . You 've turned into your own hot spot , '' She joked . <newline> <newline> I continue my work , but ca n't help but look online as to what is going on , but I notice nothing has been updated since yesterday , and by nothing , I mean nothing . No news , no Facebook , not even Reddit has had any action . <newline> <newline> '' Carol , '' I ask , `` Can you get the TV from the break room and bring it in here ? I want to see what the news says about this internet problem . '' <newline> <newline> '' No problem boss ! '' She said , getting out of under her laptop and walking out of the office . A few minutes later , she wheels in the TV , but has a couple other people following her in , carrying their own laptops . <newline> <newline> '' Hey boss , I have the TV , but a few people in other departments need to access the internet as well . Do you mind if they stay ? '' <newline> <newline> '' Not at all , '' I said , `` As long as I can hear the news , you can use the internet all you want . '' <newline> <newline> Carol turns the TV on for me , switching it to channel 5 . The news is in the middle of the weather , so I check my email again , still nothing . The news transfers back to the main anchors . <newline> <newline> '' For those of you just tuning in , there is a global internet outage . Specialists across the globe are currently working on diagnosing the problem , however if anyone has any internet access , please contact the Department of Homeland Security at the number listed below . '' <newline> <newline> I did n't understand why Homeland Security would be involved with this , but I guess they want internet just as much as the next guy . <newline> <newline> '' Hey , '' said one of the temps who came into the office , `` We should call that number . Maybe they will figure out why this office has internet and no where else does ! '' <newline> <newline> '' Hey kid , '' I say , `` Do you want to continue working in this building or do you want the government to come in here , kick us out of our own company , and use our internet access for themselves ? Because as soon as we say we have access , they will come here and use the web as if they worked in the building from the start .

It was still pretty blurry because I did n't wipe all the poop off so I wiped the camera against my bare skin to smear the poop off .

Twin wheels inched off the ground , and in one breathless moment the airplane was airborne . <newline> <newline> `` YES ! '' John shouted and pumped a fist in the air .

With a glance at his gas gauge he knew he had to return the airfield . A thought suddenly occurred to him , *how do I land ? * <newline> <newline> First to fly , first to land .

He pulled the strings tied to the flaps sending them up to further reduce his speed . <newline> <newline> He was still coming in too fast , the ground rushed to meet his small rubber wheels . John refused to close his eyes , he wanted to remember every second of this landing . With a thundering impact the plane 's wheels touched the ground , instantly blowing them out .

John 's teeth were nearly rattling out of his head as the plane bounced precariously down the runway . His grip was so tight on the stick he felt like he was going to break it in half .

It rolled and spun faster , parts of the craft were flying in every direction as it began to disintegrate around the cockpit . Suddenly the plane slid to a stop .

There are many different ways to win a game. The advantages of being able to do so will be the potential for an opposing team to get away from the opposition and it is likely that the game will become the preferred part of the game.

What are the difficulties and the challenges? What challenges have we faced as the mother and son? How have we changed our minds? In what ways have we changed? What has the meaning of life been? In what ways do we change or change? And how do we change the way we do things? In the story I have outlined, I think it is important to share the best way in which we communicate, and why we all need to be connected with others. The same is true for all of us, but the same is true for all the differences that make up the future. The fact is that the old ways of thinking are still important, and that we must not let it go. But even if we were to change, there is no room for change. Because we have different roles, different people, different responsibilities, different goals, different values, different ways of working. This may help us to change the way we look at things, but it doesn't mean we should change the way we look at things. It doesn't mean we don't have the freedom to think about the world in a new way. We also don't want to be too inanimate, or when we are working in a different direction. That's why I think we can all have a different perspective on how we do things. We need to change the way we think about things. The world needs changes. There is no reason to change what we do. We don't need to change things. We can change things. We can change ourselves. I believe that we need to be able to understand what we are doing now, what we need to do to move forward in our lives. The above is the way we can move forward in our life. I hope you will find something that you are proud of. I am not saying that we need to change, but I can say that we have a responsibility to change. It is the responsibility of the world to take the right actions and to continue to be a part of it. If we get in the way of change we need to do the right thing. If we are going to change the way we go about life, we must change. We need to change the way we think about things. How do we make sure that we are not just doing things that we want to do?

{"question": "Write an epic battle", "answer": "The cool mountain air carried the scent of danger . Thand breathed deeply of the rich scent of the forest . He was alone , a rare privilege these days . As the scion of one of the five Xopa houses , and highest ranking Xopa commander in the Imperial army , his soldiers and servants always surrounded him . He knew some of the humans under his command mocked him for keeping to the old ways of his people . He snorted to himself as he thought of the puny humans and their torches , horses , guns , and dogs . No , the true test of the warrior was to face the darkness alone . <newline> <newline> Alone in the dark , Thand drew strength from the forest . Some of the Xopa raiders captured earlier that day had cursed him as a rastilneta , the slur free Xopa used to describe their brethren who had joined the empire . Let those starving wretches call him a potted plant when he hunted alone tonight with only his blade , he thought to himself . <newline> <newline> Somewhere in the darkness ahead , under the cold light of the moon , a panther screamed . Thand ’ s blood chilled at the sound as he instinctively moved toward it . His prey was a predator herself , and he silently congratulated her on her kill . He prayed to be so lucky when he would find her . His eyes were already adjusting to the darkness , and his other senses conveyed so much more of what the woods would say . He pitied his human comrades who would never know the secrets of the forest . <newline> <newline> Despite Thand ’ s heightened senses , it was the whistling that alerted him to their presence . He instinctively dropped into the fighting stance taught to him by his teachers . As the son of a sinjoro , he had of course been taught to fight in the Imperial style , although his father had demanded that he and his brothers learn the old ways as well . The result had been a very peculiar blend of old and new that made Thand one of the most formidable fighters in the empire . <newline> <newline> The whistling intensified as a dozen Xopa warriors emerged from the trees in a rough circle around him . In the darkness their chestnut skin and rich green braids blended well with the woods . <newline> <newline> Look , a lost little rastilneta one mocked him . <newline> <newline> All alone without any men or guns to protect him another said . <newline> <newline> The speech of the Xopa sounded like the rustle of the wind through leaves , and carried the unmistakable lilt of laughter . Stepping forward into the clearing , Thand could see that they were lean , wiry and ropy , despite being nearly nine feet tall . They were naked except for loincloths , although the leader was wearing a pouched vest as well . Their simple costumes were in sharp contrast to Thand ’ s attire . <newline> <newline> Dressed in the blue and butternut of the Imperial Army of Ortinia , with his brown leather boots , Thand looked ridiculous . As Xopa were almost one and a half times the size of a man , his tunic and pants were large and loose . At his hip he reached reflexively for his holster , only to remember that he had left it behind . The only weapon he had with him was his traditional scimitar . <newline> <newline> Are you ready to die , rastilneta ? another taunted him , as the circle feinted in and out around him . <newline> <newline> Thand stoop up , revealing his impressive ten-foot height . “ I am Thandizwe sin Arakwe . My father was Galza sin Arakwe . His father was Syabu Doxar sin Arakwe . I can trace my ancestry back to Mizuxi himself . You are nothing but bandits and beggars , ” he said with a well-earned arrogance . He undid the brass buttons and shrugged off his tunic . <newline> <newline> The moonlight revealed his beautiful , scarred body . There were marks from the fights his father had demanded of him , from the duels he had fought on his long rise to power , and from his many battles for the Ortinians . He hefted the sabre as he stared at the leader . <newline> <newline> “ This blade was made in the old way , from the stinger of the giant daggerwasp . I killed the queen and drank her dream honey myself . I blooded this blade when I was but eight summers old , on raider scum just like you , ” Thand growled . His eyes flicked from warrior to warrior . Thand knew he was outnumbered twelve to one . He had to draw them in . <newline> <newline> “ When I kill you , I will burn your bodies . I will throw the ashes into the great salt . Your seed will shrivel up and die . Your spirits will be condemned to howl in the wastes for all eternity. ” This last insult finally proved too much and one warrior charged him with a fierce cry . <newline> <newline> Thand ’ s scimitar met his attacker in the throat , spilling his rich sweet blood on the pine needles . As the warrior ’ s momentum carried him forward , Thand buried his blade in the xopa ’ s back . The warrior ’ s lifeless body collapsed to the floor . A new respect appeared in the eyes of the leader and the older veterans . A growing fear warred behind the eyes of some of the younger warriors . Another charged Thand from the side . <newline> <newline> Thand dropped his", "pre": "against these monsters and a strong effort to save them. It is difficult to remember the details of the battle, but I can assure you that it will be hard to avoid. Most of the attacks are similar to those in the original battle but not so fast as they would have been attempted. The reason for this is that it was defeated a number of times and it may have changed its course. It is only a small part of the main battle and it is difficult to predict where to begin. The next few events will be the same as in the previous game. While it is a new game, the level is quite high and the attack is low. The battle is not even close to the final battle but it is a long one. If you are trying to kill someone, you can only fight against the other in the same manner. It is not that hard to fight a dead dragon in a battle. The fight itself is a complete challenge. While it is a bit of a challenge, it is a really good challenge. However, if you are fighting the game it is a good game. There are times when it is very difficult to defeat the enemy. But once you have overcome the enemies, you have the ability to fight them. You can attack the enemy quickly but it is not hard to defeat. So, if you are a diehard fighter, you should fight a good fight. You should not try to fight again but you must fight against the enemy. The main reason for this fight is that it is not a battle but a fight. However, if you are fighting a group of people, then the battle is a battle that you need to fight and fight. If you are fighting with a group of people, then you should fight the enemies that are fighting for you. You must fight for the first time. If you are not a good leader, it is necessary to fight against a dragon. This is where the game will be played. The fight is a fight that will be conducted in the dark. There is no need for a fight in the game, just fight against a fight that you have been fighting for the last 5 days. It will be a good fight to fight for. It is very important to fight against the enemies. It is also important that you are in a fight with the dragon. You can fight with all your friends and fight with the dragon. You will fight with the dragon when you are on a side-scrolling attack. You can fight with your opponent, you will fight with"}

Doug was rarely the most popular guy in the room , so this was certainly a surprise for him . Beth briefed him on the situation , while Portia offered her own analysis on the turn of events . She had not yet tried calling Alex , John , Howie or any of her remaining ex-husbands who can not be named in this story for legal purposes ( though one of them may have had a hit with “ Can ’ t Get Enough Of Your Love Babe ” among many other classics hits ) . <newline> <newline> Doug , Melissa , Josephine and Portia climbed into Doug 's sensibly priced coupe , with Beth , Andy , Anne and Bill following in Bill 's Ford Focus . Thom ( who was Melissa ’ s friend and not to be confused with her one time father Tom ) decided to stay behind , see the revellers out and clean up . Though his feelings were hurt that he was n't explicitly invited to the hospital , he understood his place . He stayed behind with Joan , another of Melissa ’ s friends and nine and a half months later Joan gave birth to their child in the same ward Melissa did . Their love making was ruined when Alex showed up to the house wondering where the party was and they had to tell him that his fiancé was giving birth . <newline> <newline> Meanwhile Doug , Melissa , Josephine and Portia ended up caught in rush hour traffic . Bill and co however , had taken the craft route and arrived at the hospital a full half hour before Melissa did . Melissa was infuriated for another reason : the baby that had finished gestating inside of her was not actually Alex 's , but instead Doug 's . Alas Melissa did n't remember their encounter because of her friend Captain Morgan . She instead believed the baby 's father to be Blaine , an Aboriginal bodybuilder . Melissa had spent the best part of her pregnancy in the fear that her baby would end up black . Alex had no black relatives that she was aware of , though he was actually distantly related to a singer that may or not have recorded “ My First , My last , My Everything ” . <newline> <newline> Josephine looked at Portia , who looked at Doug , who looked at Melissa , who thought Alex , who looked at Thom and Joan naked by his fireplace .

{"question": "You can see how a person died or will die in your dreams as long as the last thing you saw was their face before you sleep . One day you get curious and decided to see what happened to Amelia Earhart . What you see sends chills down your spine .", "answer": "The whites in his eyes had faded from their normal white that gave his striking blue eyes a stunning contrast to a pinkish color that made him look vaguely ill . The words started to blend together , the mind starting to spin . <newline> <newline> Parker blinked down as hard as he could a few times to recover some of his lost awareness . Even the hot cauldron of coffee that laid perilously next to the impossibly high stack of papers on his desk was n't helping . <newline> <newline> `` This stupid test is tomorrow and I have n't learned a damn thing , '' he said , nobody in the room to actually hear it . Parker looked upon the stack of papers , seeing literal red everywhere on them only broken up by the highlighter yellow that Mrs. Perez loved to circle when her kids screwed something up . <newline> <newline> He sighed in resignation . <newline> <newline> `` Just 5 more minutes , '' he thought , `` and then we 'll go to bed . '' He turned to the digital clock in his room , the bright red numbers reading `` 2:13 AM , '' and reopened his textbook . He was starting to fade fast , but tried to push on , holding his head up for as long as possible , his neck starting to wobble over the prospect of supporting his head . His eyelids became as heavy as horseshoes , his body just the same . <newline> <newline> At last , his head slowly turned and his rosy red cheeks met the sticky , glossy pages . His mouth started to relax open , the drool pouring out like a small stream over a picture of Amelia Earhart 's face , turning the clear snipped of a picture into a wavy sea of ink . <newline> <newline> The cask of darkness that overcame Parker slowly started to open , a shimmering blue light coming forth from the depths of his brain . The shapes started blurry but got clearer , bolder , brighter . The peach-colored malaise became flesh and bone , and a woman sitting high above the sky in her glaring silver cylinder became apparent . She had short , brownish tassels of hair poking through her brown , weathered cap , her slender face filled with confidence as she took the controls , preparing for a safe , steady landing . <newline> <newline> `` Itsaca to Earhart , Itasca to Earhart , do you read me ? '' the radio belted out . <newline> <newline> `` Earhart to Itasca , I read you . Are we clear for landing ? '' <newline> <newline> `` All clear . Itasca out . '' <newline> <newline> The woman jutted up on the brown , leather-lined handles , the plane jutting down towards the small , barren dot that protruded out from the Pacific , which went as far as the eye could see . <newline> <newline> `` Wheels out , preparing for landing , '' she belted towards the silver radio , lined with black in the cockpit . The plane landed effortlessly on this patch of matted dirt , slowed to a crawl and finally became stationary . The engine 's continuous but dull roar started to sputter before finally giving way to the crashing of waves on the beach and the gulls that would occasionally chirp out . <newline> <newline> Amelia lifted the armrest up before turning towards the side to get up , the blood still not quite back in her legs after a 6 hour flight . She opened the door , and instantly the air retaliated , the Sun pelting her with a heat and the ocean pelting her with a dampness that together made one feel like they had just been airdropped into a sauna . <newline> <newline> She pulled out her map from the leather jacket that she 'd worn , a trusty companion that had been with her from Miami to Macau . <newline> <newline> `` This should be Itsacatown , '' she said , a certain questioning tone coming over her voice . This was the right place , but something about the air made it feel a little too still . She walked over to the town , it being no more than 300 feet from the godforsaken airstrip she 'd just landed on . Peering around , poking around , the stillness became even more apparent . <newline> <newline> Amelia looked in the tiny , corrugated steel service station . Nobody was there . <newline> <newline> Amelia looked in the weathered , creaky wooden homes that were bunched together like a bundle of sticks . Nobody was there . <newline> <newline> Amelia looked in the watering hole , the cups still sitting on the bar , filled no doubt with the strongest of whisky . Nobody was there . <newline> <newline> She walked around town again and again and again , hoping to find a soul . She was unsuccessful . Finally , in despair , tired , with no fuel , and with the backdrop of the Sun 's white glow turning into a pinkish-orangish beacon over the western sky , she turned in for the night at the local inn . However , there too , she found nobody . <newline> <newline> She went upstairs , the floors squeaking . All the rooms were empty , but she found one that looked like nobody had actually been in there in a while . Taking off her black flying boots , her gloves , and resigning herself to the bed with its yellowed sheets and dusty pillows , she started to drift off , knowing tomorrow , she 'd fly again . <newline> <newline> The morning sun came belting through the windows , almost as if the sunlight was being quite literally thrown into the room .", "pre": "I really don't know if the \"suspended\" is actually a sign or the cause of the situation.

Calm your tits . '' <newline> <newline> Manny lit a smoke carefully , not wanting to burn the rubber on his prosthetic again , and watched the hulking form of Thaddeus , hobbling around on his artificial leg , transfer the boxes to the waiting truck one by one . His curiosity was burning . He was itching to pull open the lid on the nearest box and check its contents , but he knew better . Still , he stepped in close to the slowly dwindling stack and eyed it narrowly , as if his interrogation techniques would work on inanimate objects . <newline> <newline> `` What the hell *is* all this shit ?

He finished his smoke and stepped back inside the labyrinthine warehouse to find the boss , let him know the job was done .

It had n't been this tense in the place since The New Laws were passed . <newline> <newline> Every eye he had met was wide , every conversation he had had was hushed , even if it was about the most mundane thing .

He loved explaining things , Ash ; and however much he loved that , he hated gossip , presumptions , and speculation even more . <newline> <newline> `` You saw those folks leaving earlier ?

The human genome contains over 9,000 viruses and contains at least 1,000 viruses. However, the human genome does not have a genome of this size. The human genome has a range of millions of years, and it has been undergoing its own experiments on human genes. The main reason for the spread of the virus is that it is a dangerous organism. In the past, the human genome was only the first organism to undergo the various processes of human degradation. In the past, this phenomenon has become the norm in the human world. As a result, the human genome has been given a name. The human genome has now become a very large and powerful machine. The human genome has been divided into four parts: human genome, which contains the genome of a species, and. The genes of the human genome are primarily based on human genes. The human genome consists of a number of components which are used to produce the human genome. The human genome contains the entire human genome, but the genes are never eliminated.

{"question": "Aliens come to Earth in hoping to wipe us out and take over the planet , but are honorable and gives us a fighting chance . They announce they will return in 100 years so as to give Earth a chance to prepare and defend itself . Neither side expected what the other would bring to war", "answer": "What can I say . The aliens showed up and everyone pretty much lost their collective minds at the same time . Our initial weapons rush just got knocked out of the skies . Our infrastructure collapsed inside of an hour with their targeted emp pulse weapons . <newline> <newline> They said we could have a second chance . They would be back in a hundred years . What was left of the rest of us at the time , lost the rest of our collective minds for a bit longer . All the rules and boundaries went out the window . The extremists had a short field day . Then the rest of us calmed back down . Then we collectively became angry . Humans at best are usually sociable and polite , but we are very poor losers . <newline> <newline> Well it took a couple of years to get setup again . Not the entire infrastructure had collapsed , just a good part of all the electrical , oil , and natural gas distribution . But it had been enough to shut down the rest for awhile . We lost quite a few electrical generators and some nuclear power plants . No Fukushima 's and no Chernobyl 's . Staff had been quick on hand and go the rods down manually . We lost some staff to radiation though . We honor them still to this day . <newline> <newline> One world coalition is what we came up . Terram Novam . A couple of years of back and forth , a lot of sharing and a lot heavy lifting . Then we did what we did best . Make things better and worse . Well for awhile at least . The eggheads were given almost free reign . You will need to take a tour of the back side of the moon one day . Smiley face and all . <newline> <newline> Now , you really need to understand a couple of things . During the chaos that was the first decade , some little f*cker managed to program a little interface between Watson , Siri , and Google . They also tapped into some of the back ends from China , Russia , USA , and a couple of United Europe nations . Sorry , back ends . Definition : the computer networks , the super computers and clusters that were connected by Old Earth governments . Well it had an unindented effect . The programmer started getting them to talk to each other , the programmer stirred a little , and then they started learning on their own quietly . You must understand , old rivalries die hard even under threat of aliens , and fiedoms do n't get given up easily . <newline> <newline> The eggheads . Given an unmuzzled free reign came up with weapon after weapon , theory after theory , and down the rabbit hole we all went . Unbridled leaps in every field imaginable and new ones became born every 3 months . One of them was practical FTL travel . The next was multipler FTL travel . We could jusmp to Alpha Centari in just under a month . It wound up being called IFTL , Inverted Faster Than Light travel . A bubble within a bubble , without the very worst of the aging effects . <newline> <newline> Then we come to Zga . Zga was a 14 year old unknown genius . She took a phone camera , a piece of chaulk , and spent three hours going through Hawkin 's black hole theory , crossed over to Einstein-Rosen bridge , and the new FTL flight theories . Then posted it to the new uTube . It did n't get a lot of press or views at first . But an AI took an interest and forwarded it to some eggheads with direct questions . Zga did end her video with , `` This is how it is supposed to work at least , but I just do n't know about the practical side . '' Well most of the eggheads looked at it and scoffed at the idea . One did n't . Matt . Matt went through the entire video 4 times and then wrote it out on paper twice . The math was correct with no holes . Matt and Zga were published in iScience after careful reviews , but the math still held up . Then her video became more popular . <newline> <newline> The question from WSG to the eggheads was , `` How do you move an entire solar system ? '' The theory was sound , but the `` ... not sure about the practical side '' took a lot more effort . 5 years of heavy work and more theories , testing , building , moving , and more testing . When it was all done , Sol had one less planet . We offically were an 8 planet system . Pluto took one for the team . <newline> <newline> We still built our weapons , our ships , and had our backup plans . Another 5 years of building and moving . Ceres was mined out along with 75 % of the asteriod belt , Jupiter had a lot less gas , Mars used to be red , and Venus did n't glow as bright in the dark at night . Everything was in place . Then we waited , planned , revised , and practiced elsewhere . Poor Pluto , it did n't just take one for the team . It kept taking it for the team . <newline> <newline> At year 90 ( ish ? ) , we sent our message to them to come to us , we were tired of waiting .

{"question": "Mankind took their first step at interstellar travel , and unknowingly travel to a progressing alien warzone .", "answer": "The engine powered up behind us as we waited in anticipation for the first space warping flight in human history . The ship worked by folding space time and whizzing through the fold , in 10 or 15 minutes we would be by Pluto , floating in the freezing outer solar system . The engine continued to groan and pulsate and then I felt the tingling all over my body , we were moving , it was happening . The colours around us started to blur and shift , suddenly the back of the ship was in front of us , yet it was n't . Nothing made visual sense as we flew at hyper speed toward Pluto , to this day it was the most magical experience of my life , and the scariest . <newline> <newline> After 15 minutes , it stopped , there was no sound except for a buzzing , blinking red light on the dashboard . I looked outside and could n't see Pluto , or any of the celestial bodies we were told to expect . I looked at the little red blinking light , we had lost all connections with Earth , the positioning system was just throwing out errors , the computer did n't know where we were . <newline> <newline> Suddenly a black blur flew past , I looked at the other members of the crew and asked if they saw the same thing . They were n't sure , maybe it was an after effect of the space warp flight . It happened again , but this time we all saw the black blur , no one spoke , no one had a rational explanation , this was the first encounter with another alien ship because that thing certainly was n't an asteroid or anything natural . <newline> <newline> Another black blur came past the window , but stopped instantly in front of us . Our ship was now moving toward the bigger black ship , as we got closer we could see the detail it seemed to absorb light , it was blacker than the black emptiness that surrounded it , its hull was covered in rigid spiked and groves . We were still speechless , this was all happening too fast . <newline> <newline> We were dragged inside the ship by an invisible force , and were inside the cargo bay of the ship it was strange and looked different but we could just tell it was a cargo bay of some sort . The inside was mysteriously human almost like military , there was standard lettering throughout the place as if it were sectioned off into parts similar to a big military hanger we were in section 27B . The computer indicated that the air outside was breathable and fine , so we prepared to get out of the ship and meet whoever it was who owned this thing . The fear was gone now , we were the first team to fly a space warping flight , we were resigned to death from the beginning , curiosity was driving us now , not fear . <newline> <newline> As we left the ship a number of armed guards approached us , they were carrying black riffles and wearing gas masks , they were oddly human shaped . They surrounded us and as a man without a uniform or mask walked up to us , we did n't have a single weapon between us , we did n't plan on finding anything we needed to shoot at on Pluto so all we could do was wait . <newline> <newline> `` Who are you '' the unmasked man asked us . We explained we were flying to Pluto . <newline> <newline> `` Pluto was destroyed 500 years ago '' the man said , `` we are in the middle of a war with them , the others , we have colonised several of the moons in our solar system and we are defending our territory . '' <newline> <newline> `` So our co-ordinates are correct ? '' I asked . `` But the time is wrong . '' <newline> <newline> `` It seems like it '' he said , `` its the year 4500 and I am going to guess your warp drive is faulty '' . <newline> <newline> `` How do we get back ? '' I asked , holding back hysteria . <newline> <newline> The man explained that we are stuck here , they ca n't send us back and risk us being killed or captured by the enemy . So we waited , we waited in the hanger inside our ship as we heard deafening explosions all around us , we felt the huge ship shake and rattle , and finally it stopped . <newline> <newline> A team of engineers came on board and fixed our ship , several parts were replaced and we were given a box to take back . <newline> <newline> `` Give this to the intelligence forces when you get back '' he said , `` this box contains what we need to avoid this war . Since you have come from your time , you can go back into it without a paradox being created , maybe you can fix things for us here '' . <newline> <newline> We left the ship , and the computer was preprogrammed to take us back , the light around us blurred and warped again and before we knew it we were by Earth in a stable orbit . We had full communications and told HQ what had happened . <newline> <newline> We had 3 hours to kill until the re-entry window opened again , I could n't help but look in the box , there had to be an amazing piece of technology inside . <newline> <newline> I opened the box , there was nothing inside the box except a hand written note folded", "pre": "..

{"question": "You are a 12 year old son of a professional assassin . Describe what you observe at home .", "answer": "`` He was always with us . He took me to school in the morning , picked me up in the afternoon and tucked me in at night .

He cooked and cleaned and would even help me with my homework when I did n't understand something . He 's the best dad ever . <newline> <newline> But then I started to get nightmares and was afraid to go to sleep . When he tucked me in he said `` Do n't worry about anything that happens in those dreams . Nothing there can hurt you . And I would never let anything happen to you here . You trust me , right buddy ? '' I always felt better but when the light went out the shadows danced around my room . I stayed in bed because dad never liked it when I bothered him and mom in the middle of the night . Some nights I would hear him talk to someone . They never talked back so I thought he was on the phone . <newline> <newline> One night I got out of bed and went to the kitchen to get some water . I was n't supposed to have any at night because of an accident I had when I was younger but I was so thirsty . Dad left the door to his room open and I saw he was n't in his bed . I got my glass of water and drank it while I looked around to see if he or mom were home but did n't see them anywhere . I thought it would be okay for me to watch some tv while I waited for them . <newline> <newline> I do n't remember falling asleep but I guess I must 've because I woke up in my bed . My pajamas were different from the night before and I thought I could remember seeing a lot of red . It must have been another nightmare . My dad was making breakfast and called for me to get ready for school . He had a bandage on his head but he said he tripped in the tub and laughed . I went to brush my teeth and saw that the curtains still had a bit of red on them . I never thought my dad was so clumsy . <newline> <newline> The next night I had the worst nightmare ever . There were loud noises in the air and flashes of light everywhere . When I looked around I could see people lying on the ground and they were all red . When I looked at my hand they were red too . I guess I screamed cause dad was there when I woke up . I told him what happened and he said `` Do n't worry . Remember my promise ? I 'll never let anything bad happen to you . '' He kissed me on the forehead . I tried to get back to sleep but just laid in bed with my eyes open until I heard cars outside . I heard the noises from my dreams and saw the flashes of light . My dad was yelling at me to get under the bed and to hide . I did and stayed there forever . He told me he would be right back and he left . <newline> <newline> So do you know where my dad is ? Please do n't do anything to him . He 's a good dad . I know he loves me very much . And see , nothing bad happened to me . There 's no red stuff on my chest . See ?

{"question": "Working security for a high profile client , you notice an out of place looking bald janitor with a bar code on the back of his head .

Even his eyes seemed lifeless , staring straight ahead with none of the tics or movements that would indicate a living , breathing organism . <newline> <newline> I stepped up to a urinal , then paused . I glanced at the man again . He was still standing there , staring straight ahead . He seemed to be waiting . <newline> <newline> I reached down towards my zipper , then hesitated . I made a decision . Instead of taking a piss , I turned around and faced the man . <newline> <newline> Still he stood , like a statue , his vacant gaze fixated upon a point just over my right shoulder . I looked him over from head to toe . He was definitely not one of the security personnel hired for this event . I knew all the other guys , and he was not one of us . He was definitely dressed in a security uniform , though , which led me to a disquieting conclusion : he 'd taken a uniform from one of the other guards . <newline> <newline> I pondered confronting him directly . If he was trying to masquerade as a security guard , then he was probably trying to do something covertly . He might reveal something , or even flee , if he knew his cover 's blown . <newline> <newline> Then again , he might not . Confronting him could quickly lead to a fight . The security staff were issued with tasers , as well as a sidearm . The bald man looked to be in fairly good shape , so if he had a taser and a gun , then it would be too risky for me to fight him . <newline> <newline> I decided I needed backup . I would finish my business in the bathroom , then contact my supervisor . We 'd get the rest of the security staff and take this guy down together , before he tried anything . <newline> <newline> I turned back to the urinal . Before I could unzip , though , I felt a sharp prick in the side of my neck . I flailed my arms around wildly as I whirled around . The bald man was holding a half-empty syringe in his right hand . <newline> <newline> `` What the fuck ? What did you just inject into me ? What was that ? '' I yelled at him . I felt faint , but did not lose consciousness . I could fight the drug off . Maybe it was because he was n't able to give me a full dose . <newline> <newline> I was surprised to hear a girl 's voice reply . `` *What the ... that 's never happened before . The tranquilizer is supposed to knock him right out . * '' <newline> <newline> A male voice replied to her , `` *Yeah , and security guard NPCs are n't supposed to talk to you either . Is this from a recent patch or something ? * '' The voices were n't coming from the bald man . They seemed to come from all around me , like ethereal beings speaking to me from another dimension . <newline> <newline> `` Patch ? What are you talking about ? Who 's speaking ? '' I demanded . My mind was growing gradually clearer . I definitely could fight the drug off . <newline> <newline> `` *What the* ***fuck ? ? ? *** '' The male voice practically screamed out . `` *The guard just fucking talked to me ! He talked to me from the game ! * '' <newline> <newline> The girl 's voice , equally panicked , screeched , `` *Turn it off , fucking turn it off ! This is fucked up , Todd , what the fuck ? * '' <newline> <newline> Suddenly , everything around me , from the walls and urinals of the bathroom to the bald man himself , dissolved into electronic static .

Through the glass I could see two people , two gigantic teenagers , towering over me as they stared at me in utter shock . The guy , dressed in baggy jeans and a t-shirt with a heavy metal emblem on the chest , still held a video game console controller in his hand . The girl , with both hands covering her mouth out of surprise , looked like she was about to jump out of her goth outfit in fear . <newline> <newline> I looked around . It appeared I was inside a gigantic television set of some sort .

Apart from the fact that I was now apparently miniscule , and trapped inside a TV . <newline> <newline> I suppressed the panic that was gnawing at my gut . Panic later , I thought to myself .

At least I think so . I just really like art . So I became a guide in art gallery . But it ’ s not even THAT fun . We don ’ t have many original paintings , and I believe that copies don ’ t have the same sound as originals . I don ’ t know , maybe it ’ s just me . But you know that feeling when something you thought was original turns out to be a fraud ? It ’ s just feels wrong . It looks the same , sure , but it doesn ’ t *feel* the same . And it also doesn ’ t sound the same . <newline> <newline> But we are getting off track here . So you might think that my favorite art would probably be modern art – you know , all those funny sounds , different tones , notes . But well , it does not sound like dubstep . It ’ s just a mess of weird , unrecognizable sounds . Although I really do like Pollock ’ s *Mural* . Those swirls are great , like musical stave . They guide you to different scales , and sounds that yellow and that funny green of his make – oh God , beautiful symphony . A bit like Beethoven ’ s Moonlight Sonata . Bottom is more like second part , and the more you move to top the more of third movement can be heard . <newline> <newline> Same with Van Gogh ’ s Starry Night . The sky is like Summer from Four Seasons of Vivaldi , with stars and moon being Presto . Cyprus tree is spring – but the calm one . There ’ s not really much to the village , I must admit . A bit of Autumn ’ s Largo . And the middle is hard . That swirl right there – very difficult to compare . I wouldn ’ t say it ’ s the best part ( I personally prefer the rest of sky ) . It kind of mixes up Largo of Autumn and Presto of Summer – it ’ s ok , but could be better . <newline> <newline> I very much prefer older paintings , especially Rococo and Renaissance . I bet everyone wants to know how Mona Lisa sounds like – and I must say nothing extraordinary . The painting and colors are rather calm , nothing dynamic over there . And it hurts the music . It sounds like sea . Waves are lazy and slow , they don ’ t really clash but kind of dab the shore . <newline> <newline> But Rococo , that ’ s different story . Let ’ s take The Swing by Fragonard . The woman in the center is just a full orchestra , playing in perfect harmony one of fastest arrangement of Dance of the Hours by Amilcare Ponchielli I ’ ve ever heard . But there are no clash cymbals . <newline> <newline> I could go on and on with this , but let ’ s cut it short . I also hear buildings , tough they are rather low pitched . And I got used to it , so there ’ s nothing to describe . I only work one way – so I don ’ t see colors while hearing sounds . And also , I do not paint . I can ’ t paint . I mean , I can , but then the sounds are terrible , and I feel terrible . And if the sounds are nice , then the whole composition and coloring is hell . So I don ’ t do art . But I like it . <newline> <newline> ______ <newline> No synesthesia whatsover , just wanted to have a go at imagining it . Also , it does differate a bit from normal synesthesia from what I know .

The increase in the inflation rate is primarily due to an increase in the rate of inflation, a change in the amount of interest rates from the previous year, which helped offset the increase in inflation. This change in inflation was primarily related to an increase in the inflation rate. However, inflation is also a significant factor in the growth rate of inflation. In the last decade, the rise in inflation rates is primarily due to the increasing volatility in inflation rates, and due to rising interest rates, inflation has been driving the growth rate. The inflation rate has been decreasing in recent years, with inflation at 3.9% and a rate of 1.9% in 2014. This growth rate is generally used to support the inflation rate in the coming years. This is a significant difference, from a 3.1% increase in the inflation rate in 2014 and an increase in 3.2% in 2013. The inflation rate in 2013 was similar to that of 2016, with the inflation rate slightly more similar. In 2016, inflation rate was 11.2% and in 2015 the rate was 7.8%.

The only way to prevent such a behavior is by using a human character to destroy the existing hero and making it impossible for the hero to move in the world. And, as with every NPC, you cannot gain any fame or prestige in the game unless you take a role in the game. The problem of the hero is that it is actually a mission that most characters have developed to save the lives of their hero, but he is also a hero to all of the world. The hero is a hero, not a hero. The hero is a hero who has the ability to stay in touch with his enemy. When a hero is asked to kill the hero, he is not only being a villain, but also a hero. The character in the hero is a hero who does not belong to the hero's group. He is a hero whose name is actually synonymous with heroism. The hero's influence is the product of the human personality. He is the hero's most powerful symbol. He is also the first character in the game to be a hero. The hero must be a hero who is in his own path. In the game, you have to have a hero that is capable of accepting and able to use his abilities to help you. The hero is not a hero who has failed to make a hero in the game.

For the past week , we 've been eating from the box in the cabinet and the can in the pantry , and it 's hard to get excited about a pre-processed breakfast . <newline> <newline> Boy , it 's chilly in the morning .

{"question": "Everyone knows the exact time and date of their death . Your date has passed , but nothing happened .", "answer": "Immortals . They ... we were called immortals . After the last life threatening disease ever to exist on this sphere was eradicated in 5645 AD , perfection as a race was not very far away . No more hunger , no more poverty , no sickness , and most importantly , no more death . This held up for almost 6 decades and we could n't be more proud of ourselves . Our leading scientists devised a formula that recoded our DNA to regenerate indefinitely and interminably . This made us immortal . You know how they say that you acquire a new body every 10 years ? Well imagine acquiring one every 10 months . The formula was designed to also stop aging at 25 years of age , which meant you could be 100 years old and maintain the body of a 30 year old . We had made ourselves immortal . We became gods , and not gods like those of Egyptian folklore , or those found in Rome or Greece , no ! We were real gods . After almost 60 years of no deaths in the world , things were beginning to get tight . We could n't build any higher to fit all of the population and we were running out of food . Only one solution was created , an anti-formula that took our immortality , and reduced it to a mere 100 years to fulfill our dreams and desires . What were we thinking playing God . Everyone was given this `` vaccine '' and within months , those that were approaching 100 years old , those who had received the immortal vaccine back in 5645 in their mid 40 's , slowly began to die off . It was the turn of the millennium we were returning to a manageable population . Of course not everyone was ok with this . There was a small group , a small sect if you will that defied this order and never got the immortality ending formula . The formula was never made again to teach those that did n't get it a lesson that immortality is n't all that it seems to be . Of course there were public records that showed everyone 's age and their exact 100th birthday , and everyday the Remain Extracting and People Eradication Responders ( R.E.A.P.E.R ) would go out in search for those correspondents whose day it was to be , well , eliminated or extracted . So we come to me . Why am I so special ? Truth be told I 'm not , but it just happens that yesterday was my turn to be extracted . I 'm still alive , I 'm not dead . I 'm terrified , have I done something wrong ? Last night I had a dream of a man with a long gray beard . I remember lots of running and hiding . But most of all , I remember crying and bullets and blood . Why am I not dead . My time is up . I 'm 100 years and 1 day old . The REAPER has n't come for me yet and I 'm starting to get worried . Am I really complaining that I 'm not dead ? This morning I found a diary . Mostly old pictures and a letter . In those pictures are two men and a child . It 's the man with the long gray beard from my dreams ! I read the letter . My grandfather and father . The leader of the sect that did n't get vaccinated . No records of me ever existing . Bullets wo n't do good since my flesh will regenerate in a months time . I 'm stuck here forever . I have to find them ! ! !", "pre": "Please explain. I have found the correct date to write the date.

{"question": "You have had an imaginary friend . One day you find that your friend is no longer invisible to everyone , but you are .", "answer": "He sat clutched in the grip of mania , sprawling his heart across a pair of bongos and shaking the air with sophomoric passion . The inkslingers and oddballs happening to attend a combination of tattoo and anime conventions gaped with their eyes at something that could normally be ignored . Another dirty hippie , beard racing locks , trying to get across to sleeping people that love is all we got , got ta turn it up a notch , he 'd say . Until then no one could see him but me . <newline> <newline> In dreams . Then on days that felt more like dreams . Through girls and school and drugs and shitty jobs and trying to make something to be proud of , I had worn thin the joy and sincerity of youth ; I was getting colder . Then he would pop into my imagination . Scenarios so somatic that their truths were practically notarized . Then I would see glimpses of him pouring his heart out alone and dying inside in any company . The beauty inside screaming to be let out and to be understood . <newline> <newline> But he was trapped . <newline> <newline> Then , there he was . Roaring like a lion for a clap on the back and a `` Good job , hippie . '' Trying to say anything to make himself real . To feel that someone else was real . His head , a torrent with questions for reality , and everyone in charge , and anyone he walked past , but mainly himself . A collector of questions whose dam of answers was inaccessible until the series of events set in motion by several catalysts converging on his involuntarily ignorant soul . <newline> <newline> I snuck up on him . I was the only one with the tenacity to plainly pay attention , others scoffing and wondering where the hat was so they could throw IOUs into it or some other snarky substitute for <newline> `` Get the fuck out of here , you crazy hippie ! '' <newline> <newline> I did n't commend , just kept trying to pretend . Like he was a figment . But slowly inside , it became harder to hide . This ride was made for two . He 'd say . Or I might have said after a couple of days with him . A whirlwind of drugs music and good intentions , sleeping minutes a night , and trying to become something with his newfound visibility . New faces , crazy places , I ca n't recall how much I forgot about those times . We stayed on the move . Always to the next destination , always energetic , he was ; even when I , like normal people , needed rest . Things got heated , but this crazy mother fucker just made you love him . I was sure he had pure love beaming out of his forehead , using it like a weapon , cutting down malicious intent with sheer confusion and disarray . <newline> <newline> I wish I had n't asked him for the fucking shirt off of his back . Yes , I actually thought it would be funny to see if the Neochrist would practice what his bongos preached . It did n't even look good on me . <newline> Then for days , I could not explain the confusion and anger and pity and self-loathing and soon emotions just became one big blur . <newline> How could I look down on and take advantage of someone so much that I forgot to see how good of a person this poor guy thinks he is ... no , REALLY is . Inside . <newline> <newline> Oh , no . <newline> The passion in his voice is increasing daily . <newline> He 's gaining color . <newline> <newline> I 'm feeling colder . <newline> <newline> The more I took advantage , the more strength I lent . <newline> <newline> The more his passion leaked , the more demons he could vent . <newline> <newline> I became like him , trapped alone inside my head . <newline> <newline> And he will tell the world what happened to us instead .", "pre": ".. an unbroken friendship.

{"question": "A world that lay broken", "answer": "*A long time ago , there was a land that was blessed by the Goddesses . * <newline> It was fertile , bountiful , full of life . From the blue skies above to the lowest of grounds ; active volcanoes and sleeping snowy mountains . Flowing crystal water , soil which could be tampered to create new materials and crafts . <newline> Supervised by their divine eye , the Goddesses made sure that every bit was balanced accordingly and that there was nothing to be wasted , nothing that went missing .

{"question": "Finally , after years of searching , you have found the source of magic that was sealed away in the ancient past ! However , just as you are about to undo the seal , you spy some ancient text ...", "answer": "I had finally figured it all out - and Roland was not there ! It was rare for the old scholar to be out of his study on an afternoon like this . He had even left the outside door open , and his black cat Bayard was idly stalking a frog that had just wandered in . I threw Bayard into the library , the frog back outside , closed the door , and sank into the plushy armchair holding tightly to the ancient box . <newline> <newline> The long years of our search passed in front of my eyes as I closed them . I had n't thought much of Professor Roland back when I first met him - and he had a terrible reputation among my peers to boot . Who even studies Medieval Latin these days ? I was practically forced into his class after a drunken bout made me miss all other opportunities to satisfy that last , pesky distribution requirement . But when he showed up with his long white beard , calm demeanor , and the only extant copy of a breathtaking illuminated manuscript - I was instantly hooked . Has it really been 15 years of poring over old tomes together ? It felt more like a single semester . <newline> <newline> `` And that semester is almost over '' I thought proudly while looking at the old box in my lap . Just imagine the look on Roland 's face when I tell him that I , his best student and intellectual heir , had figured out how to unseal it ! Looking at it , the handiwork of Aelfgar of Lindisfarne was very pretty indeed . His contemporaries had acclaimed him as the last true wizard - and it showed . The careful engravings of angels , demons , pentagrams and other occult symbols were interspersed with knobs and protrusions that made the box look almost like the cockpit controls of a modern space shuttle . You could pull and turn and change the configuration in myriad different ways . But you had to be careful with such an old artifact . Aelfgar had made three of them , and only two were still extant . We had found them last summer in the claustrophobic confines of an attic in an old English abbey . It was really no problem to get them loaned for research - the parson did not even know he had them , much less appreciated their true value . <newline> <newline> But where was that Roland already ? ! It 's been almost an hour - and I just could n't wait to tell him my brilliant idea . It had been suggested by our conversation the night before , really . Roland had casually mentioned his finding that Aelfgar had been a follower of Saint Aedelberht ; and as I was sleeping last night my mind 's eye had put two and two together , and realized that the symbols on the box were actually the same as those in the Aedelberht Manuscript , which had deeply puzzled Roland and me not three years back . Checking my notes this morning confirmed it - the Manuscript was the key to opening Aelfgar 's boxes ! As my mentor was notorious for holding on to loaned materials , I had little doubt that the Aedelberht Manuscript was still in his possession . <newline> <newline> Impatience got the best of me at this point , and I started pacing around the room . Sheer boredom made me notice a tome that was slightly out of place on my mentor 's desk . There was a pentagram on the cover and ... by Jove , if it 's not the Aedelberht Manuscript itself ! I smiled triumphantly at my good fortune . Last night 's discussion had made Roland retrieve it , and here was the answer to all my fervent wishes ! <newline> <newline> Should I wait for the old man ? But who knows when he might be back . For all I know it will be another two hours - and in the meanwhile here I am with the old box and the manuscript ! I might as well try it - if it works I 'll show him how to open his own box . With feverish hands I follow the instructions in the old tome , pressing knobs and turning dials . What incredible works of art or wisdom might be sealed inside these amazing boxes ! The thoughts rush through my head as I approach the end of the long sequence . A final turn , and ... is this real ? ! <newline> <newline> The box slowly rises up into the air , slowly dissolving as rays of light stream out of it and into my very soul it seems . I can feel something incredibly good and powerful coursing through my veins ... it feels amazing . I can feel ... MAGIC ! ? ! Aelfgar ... he was truly the last wizard ... it was his very power that he sealed inside these boxes ! ! ... and now it 's mine ... all mine ... it 's IN ME ! I point my hand at the heavy armchair I used a few minutes ago ... and it rises up into the air , obeying my will perfectly . <newline> <newline> I am ... a wizard . Yeah , me - who would have thought ? ! Even the crusty old tome makes sense now . It talks to me about ways to use the power ... I effortlessly absorb all its wisdom ... it talks about ...

For some , their abilities had already begun to appear and this was simply a confirmation . For others , the possibilities were endless . Of course , there were the `` common '' powers- super strength , energy beams , flight . According to the pamphlets everyone got , roughly 50 % of people had such powers . There were the less common ones- teleportation , phasing through objects , rapid healing . <newline> <newline> And of course , there were the rare powers , the ones people both dreamed of having and dreaded . Time travel , telepathy , precognition . Those kinds of powers immediately secured you a job at a research lab or the military . Very high paying jobs , of course . But you got the job whether you wanted it or not . <newline> <newline> I 'd spent the night before the test staying up , dreaming of that powers I would get . Would I be able to control the weather , like my mom ? Or maybe I 'd be able to shape-shift , like my brother . He got conscripted by the army after that . Maybe I 'd be able to see him if I could do something cool like him . <newline> <newline> But then again , maybe I would get a really dumb power like my English teacher .

Maybe teaching a language made that a nifty ability , but not one I 'd want to have . <newline> <newline> When the day of the test arrived , I was both groggy and energized from almost no sleep .

You could feel the tension in the air , everyone wondering who would go . <newline> I shot forward , unable to take the anticipation . Before anyone could react , I sprinted to the shelves . I took one of the fragile bottles in my hands , held it up to the light . On the bottom was a label with a name . `` Alex Jones '' . I shrugged , not knowing who that was . <newline> <newline> `` They have our names on it , '' I guessed out loud . By then more than half the group had joined me and were busy inspecting the bottles . <newline> `` Yeah , you 're right . This one 's mine , '' the skinny girl from earlier announced . After a few minutes of shuffling and swapping , we each had our own bottles . <newline> <newline> `` Are we supposed to drink it ? '' a tall boy asked , scowling . `` What if it 's poisonous ? '' <newline> I stared at him blankly . `` Why would they want to poison us ? '' <newline> He shrugged . `` The government does all sorts of weird shit . '' <newline> <newline> I turned the bottle around in my palm . Other than my name , there were no other markings on its transparent surface . A light blue liquid swished inside of it . <newline> <newline> The skinny girl shrugged and uncapped the bottle . Before we could say anything , she downed every drop . <newline> <newline> The scowling boy all but slapped the bottle from her hands . `` Are you crazy ! ? You have no idea what 's in that !

Poison immunity , '' she sounded out slowly . `` I guess it tells you your power after you drink it . '' <newline> <newline> Not being able to stand more waiting , I wrenched the cap off the bottle , nearly crushing it in my palm . `` Sounds good to me , '' I said , taking a long swig .

{"question": "In 1977 , the Voyager spacecraft was sent out into deep space with a message from the people of Earth . Today we had it sent back to us .", "answer": "`` By Hubble , will you look at that ! '' Data scrolled at a furious rate across the Voyager mission terminals deep in a back closet at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory . After double checking the indicators , then rechecking again because he could n't believe it , mission specialist Alan Berkman bolted from his desk and up the stairs to the NASA Director 's office . Wheezing and sweating from the effort , a reminder to Berkman that he 'd spent too much time at a computer and not enough outside in his life , he barged into the Director 's office with no regard for the meeting going on . <newline> <newline> The Director stared at him with annoyance . `` What the hell ? You scientists never seem to learn what 's appropriate when it comes to office behavior ! '' Berkman peered at the little man through fogged up glasses rimed with sweat , wondering obliquely how such an obtuse person could ever become head of the world 's premier space agency . <newline> <newline> `` It 's Voyager , '' he said between gasps of air . `` She 's beaming incredible amounts of data back to us ! I do n't even know how , terabytes at a time are coming in . But it 's Voyager 's antenna without a doubt . '' <newline> <newline> He might not be a scientist , but the director was at least smart enough to realize an old space relic from the days of black and white TV should n't be reporting much of anything these days , let alone a water flood of data . Years as a politician meant the director had contributed little to the pursuit of science and human advancement , but had gained him a keen sense of when his own butt might be in danger . `` Get me NORAD , '' the Director barked at his secretary , `` now !

Deep within NORAD 's headquarters under Cheyenne Mountain a veritable army of airmen , technicians , scientists , and suits from every three-letter government agency went about their business with nervous efficiency . The word was some of the boys in Cryptology were on the verge of a breakthrough in decoding what was now termed the 'Voyager Dump ' . First contact with extraterrestrial life ... The General mulled the prospect over silently . This was a once in a lifetime opportunity . If the aliens had a message of peace , the General could surely get Congress to double or even triple the Air Force budget in the name of intergalactic relations . And if they had a message of war ? Well then Buzzkill Tolliver would be set to lead the charge in space with probably ten times the normal budget ! It would be a win either way . <newline> <newline> A clamor broke out at the nearest terminal , men started to huddle around a single monitor . `` Sir , I think we 've got it ! '' shouted a tech sergeant . <newline> <newline> `` Put it on the main screen son , '' replied the General , brushing his officer 's coat in case any lint had landed . He did n't want to look sloven for the press briefing later on . A large golden square began to de-pixilate on the jumbotron sized screen for all to see . Lines took shape , clearly etched lines on a golden metal surface . It looked like.. <newline> <newline> `` Sir , it 's a dick ! '' shouted the same tech sergeant . True enough , a twelve foot tall etching of a human male anatomy stood displayed for all to see . The General turned beet red . <newline> <newline> `` What in the hell kind of joke is this ?

'' In glorious high resolution , the male member <newline> was displayed for all to see . Questions swirled immediately . Was this a hoax ? Some sort of fraud ? Every indication seemed to be that the transmission had some from deep space via Voyager 's equipment , but how would it get an image from a completely different probe , let alone one so vulgar as this ? <newline> <newline> The computer spat out additional data . `` Sir , I think the decrypting program is picking up a number of text based artifacts in the transmission . Displaying them now ! '' Excitedly , the airman let the messages roll off to the big screen as the program finished . <newline> <newline> `` Sweet Jesus ... '' muttered Buzzkill Tolliver . As the words spilled onto the screen , it was clear explaining this to Congress would be difficult . <newline> <newline> *Hay hooman , why so small ? It cold in space ? * read the first message . *Lololo probe probably sent by hooman females looking for real pachingiang ! * The program was clearly filling in with garbage for parts of the message it could n't translate . *How you expect to explore galaxy with such tiny male parts ?

The Voyager crew was connected to the company's communications system and had a digital radio. It was a machine that could communicate with the Voyager. Voyager had five more satellite satellites from which to launch. It was also able to conduct one of the first commercial missions with two satellites. That's a great technology for the future. We can now see that Voyager had a complete set of spacecraft that was able to be fully launched in the next few days. The Voyager team also had a few larger satellites that were built from the ground up. If we see a powerful spacecraft in space, we will have a very high confidence that the Voyager was fully capable of anything. So we are confident that the spacecraft that we are going to be able to launch with the spacecraft will be able to deliver us a total of three satellites, at a rate of 10 billion each. It is also a great project that we are building. The Voyager spacecraft is not only the largest spacecraft in the world, it is also the first spacecraft that we can use to fly satellites. This spacecraft will be able to orbit around the Earth using the same mechanical design as the spacecraft that we are using today. We are going to take the spacecraft to a planet that is on a mission. The Voyager spacecraft is a rocket. This is the first spacecraft that we are on at the time of this mission. In August 2008, we had the mission that was being launched for the first time. It was the first spacecraft that was launched with a spacecraft that was on the way to launch. The Voyager spacecraft that we are looking at is going to be able to fly the first spacecraft. We are going to be taking a look at the spacecraft that is coming up next.

{"question": "You meet a genie that grants one wish . You wish to go back in time and change your biggest mistake . You get taken back to the time right before you made your wish .", "answer": "*Moscow* <newline> *15th March , 1938* <newline> The sun rose bright and strong as the legendary revolutionary was marched into a bare prison yard . His toothless mouth moved endlessly as he waited for his fate . His expressionless face , sturdy as stone , was not allowed to betray his emotions the same way his mouth was not allowed to betray his comrades during his various 'extraordinary interrogation ' sessions which he was forced to endure . <newline> <newline> His captors shoved him down on to the floor . <newline> <newline> He knew his fate was final . <newline> <newline> A nagging voice bound to his subconscious finally broke free , filling his mind with is suppressed emotions . He realised the truth that he had brought this to come , his adamant unflexibility in strategy driving away the most valuable minds and dooming the revolution . The chilled barrel of a rifle nuzzled against his neck was now a soothing liberation . Finally faltering , he began to take solace in one of the various revolutionary songs , croaking his way through the lyrics and using them to bandage his heart . <newline> <newline> The bullet was entering his brain as he rubbed his fingers against the one thing he was allowed to keep in his prison ; a sacred ring which even the Tsar believed was sanctified . He knew the grievous consequences of his actions , they no longer bothered him as his only desire was to shelter himself from his actions ; to correct his error . All was dark as his eyes closed for the final time . <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> He awoke . <newline> The first thing which he noticed was the lack of anything substantial around him . It was a hole in the world ; a void which was in stark contrast to the dreadful prison in which he was interrogated and finally executed . <newline> The second thing he noticed was that in fact he was wrong ; there was a luminous being behind him . <newline> <newline> `` H-hello ? '' He whimpered . <newline> <newline> The luminous creature neglected to respond . <newline> <newline> `` What is this place ? '' His voice raised slightly . <newline> <newline> Still no response . <newline> <newline> He waited for a few minutes until his patience started wearing thin , until he became aware of the fact his fingers had rubbed against the holy ring . <newline> <newline> `` T-take me back ; take me back before I made Ulyanov turn Koba away . Please , Genius , allow me to repent for the suffering which I caused . '' <newline> <newline> Suddenly , all was awash with white as the world started spinning . He blacked out a second time . <newline> <newline> <newline> *Moscow* <newline> *15th March , 1938* <newline> <newline> He was marched to an open yard in a stark gated complex . A rifle was pointed to the back of his head as he was forced onto his knees . He struggled to recall the previous happenings as new memories flooded his mind . <newline> <newline> He remembered the talented revolutionary Josef Dzhugashvili , now known by his pseudonym Stalin . In old times , that pseudonym was instead Koba . He remembered how Vladimir Ilyich 'Lenin ' Ulyanov had taken on to this intelligent , political young man , how he had entrusted him with the most important responsibilities . He remembered the famines which were caused by the forced collectivisation which Stalin proposed . Finally , he remembered the treacherous Purges , where old comrades were forced to sign false confessions and were promptly imprisoned and shot . <newline> <newline> A deeper understanding of the futility of struggle was made known to him . The last thought which flitted through Bukharin 's mind as the executioner pulled the trigger was ; what was the difference between Stalin and the Tsar ? <newline> <newline> *Nikolai Bukharin was executed March 15th , 1938 . One of the greatest Bolshevik theorists and a most ardent revolutionary , he was betrayed by his political ally Stalin and executed for false crimes . * <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>", "pre": "You begin to realize that you have no choice.

{"question": "An actually competent henchman manages to kill the superhero .", "answer": "The nuclear superweapon factory warehouse echoed with the sharp bang of metal on concrete . Griff stared at his companion , Snakes , in disbelief . <newline> <newline> `` Are you kidding me , Snakes ? '' Griff whispered sharply . Snakes shrugged sheepishly . <newline> <newline> `` Why would you try to hold in a sneeze , '' Griff continued , `` by covering your mouth with your hands *when you 're holding the deadliest weapon known to man ! ? * Wipe your hands and pick it up ! We got ta get out of here before a superhero shows up . '' <newline> <newline> Snakes hung his head ashamedly and wiped his hands on his henchman uniform before bending to pick back up his end of the metal crate . Inside the crate was a Nuclear MacGuffin that the two henchman had been tasked to steal ... silently . <newline> <newline> Carrying the crate awkwardly between them , Griff lead the way to their escape route through the conveniently placed sewer grate in the floor . When they arrived at the grate , they noticed it was closed . <newline> <newline> `` Odd , '' whispered Griff , `` Did you close the grate after you came out , Snakes ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Uh , no , why would I do that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I dunno , but it 's closed . Sit the crate down and let 's pry it back open . Hurry ! '' <newline> <newline> From up in the rafters , a voice chuckled . It was a pitying chuckle , filled with confidence . The henchmen dropped the crate and whirled around . `` I would n't worry about that , boys , '' said the voice , `` I welded it shut with my eyes . '' A blue glow suddenly sprang up in the rafters above . `` Now step away from the crate and I 'll go easy on you . '' <newline> <newline> Snakes looked ready to run , but Griff just gritted his teeth and sad , softly , `` No . Not this time Laze , '' and drew his gun . The glow descended from the ceiling , revealing a muscle-bound man with eyes of blue fire floating gently down to land a short distance from the henchmen . He smiled . <newline> <newline> `` Mister Sinister must be strapped for cash , sending only two goons for a job as big as this . Why , it 's hardly worth my time to put on my spandex and come out . The local police could have handled you two doofuses . '' His eyes blazed blue and hot . `` In fact , I 've already c -- '' <newline> <newline> Griff 's gun roared to life , interrupting Laze and sending a bullet to visit the space between his beautiful blues . Laze stumbled and fell , spurting out a gout of blue flame-beams from his eyes before landing , face down and unmoving , in front of Snakes . <newline> <newline> Snakes stared , wide eyed , as the blue glow faded from Laze , before slowly turning to stare at Griff . <newline> <newline> `` You ... you killed him , Griff ! '' Snake yelled . <newline> <newline> Griff smiled and tucked away his gun . `` It looks like I did . Someone needed to do it . He was always making our life hell . '' <newline> <newline> Snakes shook his head . `` Yeah , but you did n't even let him finish his speech ! That 's not very sportsmanlike . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , come off it , Snakes ! He was always interrupting Mister Sinister 's exposition ! Remember last time ? He sent Mick to the hospital . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , yeah , but there 's rules , you know ? It 's like an unwritten thing . And , do n't give me Mick ! Our healthcare package is phenomenal . '' <newline> <newline> As the two henchmen argued , a faint green glow grew in the air between them . Finally , after a narratively silly amount of time , they noticed . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , what 's that light ? '' Snakes asked , `` Is Laze alive ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No , he 's blue colored . This is green , '' Griff replied , `` It looks like its coming from the ... oh . Oh no . It 's coming from the crate , Snakes ! Laze must 've blown a hole in it when he died ! '' <newline> <newline> `` You think it 's gon na blow ? '' Snakes asked . <newline> <newline> `` I dunno , but let 's get out of here . Help me with the grate . '' <newline> <newline> The henchmen ran to the sewer grate and tried to open it , forgetting that it was welded shut . The crate began emitting an electric whine that steadily increased in pitch . As the whine reached a crescendo , the two henchmen comically embraced , squeezing their eyes shut and screaming . A moment later , the crate hissed and went silent . The henchmen continued hugging and screaming until a voice in the shadows cleared its throat . <newline> <newline> `` Excuse me , boys , but ... uh , put your hands up and stop holding each other !

There are also scenes where the crimes begin to take shape. I really do think that would have been a nice movie for a show about a man who has become a prison man. I love the idea of a series that was a great thrill to see the superhero's career turned into a good comic. He's not a great actor, but he is one of the best writers I've seen in a long time. So much for the quality of the film. I really like the way he paints the world in his own light. The issue of the hero's unblemished status is a very good one. A lot of the time, it's just kind of a personal issue for the reader. I think that's why it's not even a good look at the issue of the actor who is finally getting a good look at his character. It's just a question of whether or not he really is a hero. I think this is a great story. But even if he's still a good superhero, I'd love to see him go through some difficult things. I think the issues of the MCU and Marvel are definitely an issue, and there is not a lot of depth to the issue of the possibility of a superhero in the MCU. I'm not a fan of the superhero. I think that the issue of a superhero being a superhero is an issue that needs to be addressed. The issue that I think would be really interesting is the concept of a superhero that is not just a superhero, but a superhero that is trying to change a world and solve a problem. There are a lot of issues that the hero must solve, but not all of them. I think the issue that the superhero is facing is a lack of justice and opportunity for the hero to live up to his or her potential. There are a lot of issues that the superhero needs to solve, but the challenges that a superhero could face are that of a superhero who has to overcome all the challenges that he's faced. He's a character that is going to face the worst and have to overcome them, but it's not going to be easy. I think that's a good choice for me. I think that the hero needs to be told to live in a place where he has a place to go and just have fun. If it's a superhero that has a real good chance of"}

In the future humans have quickly become feared throughout the Milky Way as our soldiers are ready to eat almost anything ... or anyone .", "answer": "Sargent Wilks sat feeling somewhat confused about why he was being raked over the coals because of a drop-ship malfunction . The tribunal stared at him angrily while asking the same questions over and over again . He felt like he 'd been asked how the pod malfunctioned by seven different people , and now an eighth was asking . <newline> <newline> `` You expect us to believe that a billion dollar pod manufactured by Stegus Corp , with triple redundant guidance systems and a host of tech meant to keep it together under high g-force , the vacuum of space , and under heavy ordinance fire just disintegrated upon reentry into H1M1 's atmosphere ? '' The woman who he could n't quite place was almost spitting out each word . <newline> <newline> `` No ma'am . Like I said before , '' he said nervously `` it was after main reentry . The capsule passed through something , a cloud or layer of atmosphere that never happened on any simulations , and then all the tech went down . It was a few seconds after that that the shell peeled off in bits . '' <newline> <newline> `` That 's completely unbelievable Sargent . '' The woman huffed . Someone approached her and whispered in her here and she sneered even more . `` I have nothing more for this ... person . '' He later learned that she was the technical liaison between Stegus Corp and the military . <newline> <newline> Another questioner leaned forward in his seat to look down upon Wilks . <newline> <newline> `` So the story so far is the pod dissolved , you pulled the e-chute in your suit and got dumped into the ocean , is that right ? '' The man said in a seemingly nice tone . <newline> <newline> `` Yes sir . '' Wilks responded . <newline> <newline> `` And after that you found yourself on an island without any rations ... '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes sir , the rations were in a pack built into the pod along with weapons and ordinance . '' <newline> <newline> `` But you were n't issued a weapon for this flight , is that correct ? '' <newline> <newline> `` No sir , this was just a simulation . We were supposed to be popped , attempt a no-g egress , ingress and return . '' <newline> <newline> `` But you ended up on planet ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes sir '' Wilks responded , again . <newline> <newline> `` So for four days you were on planet without equipment , no beacon , and no weapon and survived on this little island .

'' Wilks said sheepishly . <newline> <newline> `` Sargent , did you or did you not hunt down , kill , and eat while you were on the island ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well ... yeah ... uh ... yes sir . On day three ... I uh ... I was pretty hungry at that point and had n't been able to catch any fish or anything , so I went inland ... '' he recounted . <newline> <newline> `` And ... '' the man asked . <newline> <newline> `` And there were these crabs , sorta hairy but like crabs we have back home ... and um ... they climbed up on this tree I guess . I mean it looked sorta like a tree but not really our kind of tree . I figured they might be edible , so I tried to get them out of the tree but they went pretty high up . At that point I had a sharp rock already so I just hacked the tree down .

{"question": "A couple come to the end of their relationship and one of them decides they should break up . There 's no arguments , only an 'OK ' .", "answer": "The smoke rose slowly from the glowing end of the cigarette , blue smoke rising in a straight line , undisturbed by any moving air . <newline> <newline> I sat staring at my screen , the same words had been staring back at me for almost two weeks now and next weeks rent would see the last of the grant money . <newline> <newline> `` Aspiring writer '' . That 's how I would describe myself . `` I write books '' would be the reply to the never ending question of `` What do you do ? '' . Yet here I was , six months down the line , seventeen chapters written and nowhere further to go . The inspiration had stopped a while ago now . Calling yourself a writer comes with advantages . It means brains , it means confidence , it means interest ; with those things comes women . Women who want to tell their friends that their boyfriend is a writer , who want to be some sensitive soul 's muse . To be the inspiration for some beautiful piece of work . A penniless romantic , what could be better than that ? <newline> <newline> I have a way with words , always have . Any argument or dispute in a relationship could be dealt with . she 'd tried to leave me six times now . I talked her out of it every time . It only took five minutes- it was why she fell for me in the first place . She knew she could come to me with any issue and I could make her feel better about it in five minutes . It was a critical way of living , but it worked . The women do n't leave because I convince them that it just does n't make sense . Every discussion would carry a different theme . Guilt , perhaps . That was always an easy one , especially when it was constructed to lead themselves to that conclusion- when the only response is `` I 'm being selfish . '' They never leave- Not when I 've written myself as the perfect partner . <newline> <newline> I suppose that 's where the inspiration goes . I stop writing when I 'm too busy writing myself . It 's a lot of effort to hide everything , to make sure you cover every plot hole , to set up placements for later developments . The discussion is written before she even comes into the room , I know how she 'll react because by this stage , I 've practically written her too . <newline> <newline> She 'll walk in after work today- she 'll tell me she 's having doubts again . `` Not spending enough time with me '' is what she 'll say . But I 've already worked it out . <newline> <newline> `` I understand that . I know it 's hard . I hate it as well , but I 'm still struggling with the writing . I 've written quite a lot this week , you 've really helped me through it all . I need you to understand that I do appreciate everything we have and whilst I know its not been that fair on you , I 'm doing it for both of us . Once this gets published I 'll have so much more time for us . You said you wanted to go to Rome again , we can do that as soon as the first check comes in . I love you babe , you know I do . I 'm not choosing to spend time away from you , that 's the last thing I want- but I have to do this right now . Soon that will be over and we can just go back to how it was . We 'll be back to watching DVDs at night , I promise . Just a couple of more weeks . I love you . '' <newline> <newline> Always end with I love you . They have to say it back , especially after that . It 's my sacrifice , its my hardship , and she 's just a passenger . I do n't say it , but that 's how it will make her feel . Hell , it will probably lead to guilt sex . <newline> <newline> Still , that being said , the grant money does run out next week ... <newline> <newline> She walks into the room and looks at the half burned out cigarette on the desk . As I type furiously on the keyboard she walks up behind me . <newline> <newline> `` Babe , I really feel like we are n't spending enough time with one another . '' <newline> <newline> `` OK '' <newline> <newline> For five minutes she stands there . Not saying anything . She 's waiting for me to stop typing , to turn around and smile and start my speech . <newline> <newline> I stop typing and press enter ; new chapter . As I start to type , the door slams behind me . <newline> <newline> <newline>", "pre": "I doubt he would understand. The only way to start this process is to have a little fun.

{"question": "Global warming is melting the ice caps , revealing a previously hidden archaeological evidence of ancient motor vehicles and industrialized society .", "answer": "Of course , everyone thought it was some sort of elaborate hoax at first , save for the most eccentric of conspiracy theorists . But over time , it became increasingly obvious that this was either the most elaborate prank in human history or there was something far more sinister going on beneath the ice . <newline> <newline> The discoveries swiftly grew from estranged piles of nuts and bolts and engine parts from outdated cars to nearly fully intact farm equipment and even what appeared to be parts of sky-scrapers , all preserved quite pristinely save for the hardened sheets of millennia-old ice . News coverage around the world quickly shifted from political upheavals in the Middle-East and mindless celebrity trivia to nearly 24/7 coverage of the `` Glacier Race '' . Quite akin to the Space Race of decades past , this revolutionary discovery had sparked a new era of innovation and scientific study that boosted the morale of citizens the world-over and helping to get the global economy out of its rut . <newline> <newline> However , as the years went by , that driving spark of curiosity was soon twisted into a smoldering morbidity at the discoveries being made . It was 2023 when the first body was discovered . With a sinew-laden arm and bony fingers extended as though reaching for help , a well-preserved human corpse was discovered beneath the newly-dubbed Zone 4 of the arctic layer . The first three Zones , each taking up several miles of glacier , had only contained ancient machinery and old-fashioned technology , but as the ice melted and humanity delved , a grim portrait of our evolutionary line was painted before our eyes . Contained perfectly within the sapphire-blue depths was a makeshift fossil record of human-kind . The global uproar was too large to be contained or covered up , and mankind was forced to face new questions about its existence that it had n't encountered before . Had others existed before them ? What did this mean about Earth 's past ? What did it mean for humanity 's future ? <newline> <newline> All of this was for naught , however , when the rising ocean levels and increasing global temperature took its miserable toll upon the surviving ten countries . The project was abandoned , and we never got to unveil the deepest layers of ice , what laid below Zone 4 , and humanity focused solely upon its survival . It was the year 2135 when the toxic fumes that had taken the place of the ozone layer finally suffocated its last victim . The planet by this point was an utterly barren , frozen wasteland , much of the surface having been flooded and irradiated beyond livable conditions .

She was itching to prove herself , obviously . She was inspiring , but she was suspended for several months after trying to possess multiple entities at once . It ’ s very dangerous if you didn ’ t know . Only a rare few have ever survived that very feat . <newline> <newline> We spent a lot of time together in those months , and we soon became fast friends . She was grateful , but she also came to find she could confide in me . For I was the only other demon in existence at the time who had survived a multiple possession . It ’ s a euphoric experience , which is hard to kick . It ’ s for good reason that you are put on suspension . That , however , does not mean you have all the free time in the universe . You must ride out your punishment as an on call , to be summoned , demon . <newline> <newline> The only warning you receive is for a mere 5-10 seconds before being summoned you go blind and deaf except for a faint buzzing in the ears . I explained this all to our newest recruit , for she was frightened . You may have expected a harder reserve from a demon , but we are very misunderstood . As I told you before , we celebrate Christmas . I mean there are of course more virgin sacrifices then mistletoe but I ’ m sure you can see the fun in that . <newline> <newline> I had to go back 70 years to explain my stint for the on call punishment I served . Times have certainly changed , but I ’ m telling you , teenage girls have not . Oh yes , these were the most offensive of punishments . For there is nothing more fearsome than a teenage girl . Unfortunately , thanks to the different timezones , you could be called on at any second of the day . Most importantly , due to one of the 666 rules we have to abide by ( of course ) , we have to stay with those that call upon us until we are released . <newline> <newline> I shared all I could with my young apprentice as she peppered me with questions . I tried to explain that her experience as an 8 yr old girl would be far different than mine as a nearly 1200 yr demon permanently stuck as a 74 yr old man . I ’ m sure her plight will not be easy , but I hope her patience lasts longer than mine did…", "pre": ".. the demon! What a brutal killing for a teenager. Is it even possible that someone else has been a victim of demonophobia and demonophobia? No, it is a psychotic demon, and the demonic children are no different than the demonic victims of the demonic children. Well, maybe the demonic victims are not exactly the same people that are coming in to kill the demonic children. I think there is a good chance that some demonic children are not being used to the same level as their demonic opponents. That is a very worrying thing. But there are some more dramatic situations and the focus has been on the demonic children. For instance, the demonic children are being targeted for being \"obedient children\" because the demonic children are using drugs, for example, to put their children in harm's way. It is this demonic child that is being abused by the demonic children, and the demonic children are playing with the demonic children for so long. So, what is the demonic child being that demonic child? There are two kinds of demonic children. One is demonic child and the other is demonic child. These demonic children are in the demonic part of the human world. The demonic child is not human. There is no human being. The demonic child is being used to manipulate the human body. The demonic child is using a demonic child to transport his demonic child to the demonic child. The demonic child is using demonic child to kill the demonic child. The demonic child is killing the demonic child. It is killing demonic child. The demonic child is killing the demonic child. The demonic child is killing demonic children. The demonic child is attacking the demonic child. The demonic child is killing the demonic child. This is killing demonic child. The demonic child is killing the demonic child. The demonic child is killing the demonic child. The demonic child is killing the demonic child. This demonic child is killing the demonic child. The demonic child is killing demonic child.

The Island is a high-rider and has some of the world's largest fishing fleets. The island is at odds with the vast natural resources of the island. The island's history is further complicated by its continued precariousness. The island is home to millions of people and is home to more than 500,000 people.

The island is known for its beautiful beaches, pristine beaches, and peaceful beaches. Although its fishing reputation is relatively unknown, the island is known for its long-lasting wildlife. The island is inhabited by people from the Caribbean, and the people live in many areas of the island. The island's population is about 29,000.

The power lines never went down , but occasionally did develop noise that could create power surges , but Max hardly ever saw signs of that . <newline> <newline> By the time the Foundation Day tune stopped , Max had grown bored of watching the winds of the Curtain buffet a pair of workers as they got into their cab of the monorail . Their destination one of the many cities on the night side , to be sure . Max 's shift did n't end for hours . maybe he would cheat a bit and watch a vid . He was n't supposed to , but when the Supervisor was n't around , the only person in the facility was himself . <newline> <newline> Max had been watching an old series about Earth . Earth was a proper planet that had day and nights and weather and a moon and a star that did n't look like a boil . Not that anyone ever heard from Earth much anymore , apparently for the past couple of hundred years , there was some sort of ecological disaster there , Max did n't know the details , it did n't matter , the vid 's story was set from before the Diaspora when electricity was n't discovered yet . Max watched it with a longing that he felt in the deepest parts of himself . There were animals , green grass , and women who 's only concern in life was which wealthy man they wanted to marry . The world just supported them , not like on Coin , where every inch of life needed to be taken from the light side and carved out of the ice on the dark side . Max liked to imagine himself as a farmer . <newline> <newline> There was an alarm . It was strange to hear , because Max had previously only heard it on training vids . He looked over at the console and saw that there was no power on his lines . Something had gone terribly wrong . There was no power ! Max tripped the alarm and got on the phone with his contact at Solar Array 42 . It rang and picked up . <newline> <newline> `` Steve ! Steve ! Are you there ? What is going on ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Max ! They 've set off bombs ! '' Steve replied . `` They are shutting down the power to all of Coin ! <newline> <newline> `` Who ? '' Max yelled the question . The lights from the street outside started to go out . <newline> <newline> `` They call themselves The Liberation Army of Gelise . They are- '' the line went dead . <newline> <newline> Max looked up and the lights went out in the office as well . The only light coming from his badge and communicator . Outside his window , the only light was being belched from the north , all power was off . Max knew from his training , how much time there was to restore power before the night side froze , 3 days . Max also knew without the monorail , nobody from the night side was going to be able to get to the borderlands , where you could live if you could stand the winds . <newline> <newline> Max knew what he had to do , if Coin was going to survive , he needed to get the power back on .", "pre": "A side view of the Earth.

{"question": "A boy asks a girl out . It 's high school . It 's awkward . Narrate it from the point of view of a nature documentary .", "answer": "And here we see the first of several stages of mating rituals in the humans . <newline> <newline> The first is often the most unsuccesful in creating long term relations , yet mostly serves as practice for future , more significant rituals . Perhaps ironically , this first mating ritual is more complicated than any of the others , often occurring at the age of 16 . <newline> <newline> Ah . Here we see a lone male approach a female . It is often the male that begins the ritual , despite both parties equally capable of feeling emotion , and this one knows his trade . He stands up straight , walking with a confident swagger a slight smile playing across his lips . It is a delicate balance , the beginning of this ritual , and the most crucial - for if the initial approach fails , the ritual stops before it can even be started . <newline> <newline> Nevertheless , this quite adept male approaches the female in his buttoned down shirt and well groomed hair , putting him miles ahead of the rest of his unshaved , ungroomed pack . He has been watching the female for a while now , has even conversed with her , and knows when she is normally without her pack , for normally females of this age travel together in order to further intimidate males , such that only the most confident may dare approach , naturally making mates of a higher quality . <newline> <newline> The approach is something to marvel at , truly . Light on his feet , but no so light as to be malicious he walks up behind her taps the female on the shoulder . She whirls around , her mouth an O of surprise . The male apologizes , insisting he didn ’ t mean to startle her , and the female smiles , understanding . The two talk for a bit of casual , superficial things . This is the most important part of the dance , the feigning disinterest . They both know there is only one reason the male would seek out the female in such a fashion , yet they do not bring it up . They talk of sports , of class , of other males and females . In fact , the male says goodbye and turns to leave . Now the female frowns , confused , but at the last moment the male asks the question . Done in such a way as it were an afterthought , that he had not initiated the whole conversation with that in mind . <newline> <newline> The female smiles and , nonchalantly , says why not , as if she were merely not opposed to the idea when in reality she is delighted . <newline> <newline> Both walk away , jubilant , blissfully unaware of the other ’ s desire . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> However , this is an ideal ritual , where the approach , the evasion , the time , the look are all executed with almost utmost perfection . <newline> <newline> But most such rituals are doomed to failure due to mishaps , often on the male side . Recall , that it is the male who propositions , and thus he has more room for mistakes . <newline> <newline> Let ’ s take another male . Already we see the differences from the first . His hands are rubbing together in nervousness , his skin is oily , his air unkempt . And perhaps worst of all he has worn an attire known as Cargo Shorts .

He walks , lumbering as he does , so the entire pack stares at him for 30 seconds are so until he finally reaches them . <newline> <newline> His face red he does not banter or feign disinterest , no , he just asks the question . The female smiles and opens her mouth to answer , but before she can her pack howls in laughter . The female freezes , and after a moment ’ s hesitation , forces herself to chuckle .

{"question": "The USA finally gives in to ongoing claims that music is turning youth violent by outlawing all forms of music besides country and implementing a system that promotes alcohol consumption and dog ownership .", "answer": "The Dog Hard movement began with the First Lady and swept the nation like a fire across a dried out prairie . She wasn ’ t the First Lady when all this started , but her party did own both the House and Senate when the law banning all forms of music other than country was passed . After the next election when her husband took office she decided to make dog ownership and country music pride the focus of her work . <newline> <newline> Rock musicians took it badly . Most simply faded away and did other things with their lives . Some tried to change and become country musicians , but it was clearly so disingenuous that few had any real success . Miley Cyrus somehow reinvented herself again . After years of branding herself as edgy to escape her country-fried roots she was pulled back into the world she wanted to leave and not wholly embraced . Her large number of dogs , however , kept her in the public eye . Miley ’ s Tongue is now the largest dog based charity in the nation . <newline> <newline> Suddenly owning dogs became a status symbol . I ’ m not talking about being a hipster with a Corgi or a Pug that has an ironic sweater , but owning multiple dogs was the new hip thing . The bill allowed you to write off your dogs as if they are children , but in order to do so you have to treat them as such . Overnight the cottage industry of dog clothes , furniture , and gourmet treats exploded . <newline> <newline> It all makes me sick . I sit in my house and look out the window and see people walking by with multiple dogs on leashes ; dogs dressed in costumes ; dogs with designer hats ; dogs eating better food that I eat , and I have to swallow down the bile . My neighbor has a Prada shit scooper and she has trained her smallest dog , a Yorkie named Sampson that wears “ vintage Hollywood ” clothes , to back up and poop directly into the scooper so she doesn ’ t have to scrape the crap off the ground . With her designer dogs and her Garth Brooks filled iPhone she is the First Lady ’ s wet dream . This woman took the Dog Hard movement to the extreme . <newline> <newline> Dog Hard started out as a way to promote dog ownership . With the tax breaks and rules that came with them so came waves of commercials for dog adoption . For the first time in decades shelters actually had a shortage of dogs . Breeders were the new rock stars . Where Gordon Ramsey , Bobby Flay and other celebrity chefs used to rule cable TV , now celebrity dog breeders and trainers ran networks . The nation was dog crazy . The status symbol of them spoke volumes . The more dogs you had , the more you loved your country . You did n't need to wave the flag when you could just Dog Hard ! <newline> <newline> At a time when the nation was at its most divided politically , ideologically , and socially , somehow , in some strange way , dogs and country music pulled us all together . The whole thing reeked of 1984 . Somewhere I think Orwell is spinning in his grave . <newline> <newline> I grab my coat , wallet , and keys then head outside . I need some fresh air . As I pull out of my driveway the couple from a few houses down that has decided they will only get giant dogs trots up the sidewalk . They have three massive dogs that each weight well over 100 pounds on leashes . The biggest is a wearing a jacket that would fit me . They smile and wave to me . I wave back . She doesn ’ t realize I have my window down and can hear her when she says to her husband , “ I don ’ t understand what his problem is. ” <newline> <newline> What ’ s my problem ? Maybe I don ’ t like being manipulated . Maybe I don ’ t want other people telling me what to listen to . Maybe I sometimes fear that in the middle of the night the feds are going to smash in my door and sweep me off to jail because of the collection of heavy metal CDs I keep hidden in my closet . These are some of my problems , but the real issue , the festering core of my anger , mistrust , and general hatred of this world that I now live in that is awash in custom built dogs and shitty country music… is that I own a cat . <newline>", "pre": "...more"}

{"question": "Everyone knows the exact time and date of their death . Your date has passed , but nothing happened .", "answer": "I thought about it again . I could n't really explain how I `` knew '' , but it was something that people were always able to conceive , just like a sixth sense . The ability to tell when one 's own life was going to end , the except time and date . For some people they shared it openly and constantly , and for others they kept their times hidden away . For some people , a far-off date and time was a sign of prestige . Hell , some people even had benefits if they were either due for a super long or super short life . <newline> <newline> <newline> But it did n't make sense . I thought about it , and I thought hard . Like I said , I still do n't know how I was able to just bring it to head , but I could . And despite the numbers floating through my mind simply reading `` December 19th , 2030 '' , nothing had happened . Interestingly , the cause of death is not determined , just the time and date . So for some people they 'd simply off themselves on the day . Others would get themselves all tucked and cozy in their beds and then simply die in their sleep inexplicably . Others were not so lucky , getting shot by gang members or hit by Maglev trains on their daily commute . <newline> <newline> <newline> I personally had already fulfilled what I wanted for the day , and was planning to end my life simply with a Beretta M9 . I had a nice plate of Fugu Sashimi . A bit of a risk but hey , if I was gon na die today , might as well go for it . I had watched a nice movie , finished a good read , chatted with some of my friends before saying goodbye , for the last time . Of course , they did n't know , but they 'd understand when they saw the news . I never liked talking to people about when I was gon na die , so I mainly just kept it to myself . But regardless , I was still boggled . <newline> <newline> <newline> The day ended , and December 20th dawned . It must be a fluke . Surely it had to have been , right ? But it could n't have .

It felt like an eon since that time had passed when in reality it had only been 41 minutes . And so I got ready for the next day of work . What was I to even do ? I could n't just stop . Surely if the clock did n't read right then there was something else , there had to be . But I tried to push it to the back of my mind , and put on a smile for everyone . Go through my daily routines and rituals , talk with my girlfriend , and the other various daily deeds . <newline> <newline> <newline> But as the days passed I could n't stop thinking about it . I stayed up late trying to fathom it , I worked across the day on my writings about it . Study after study , I ended up getting careless .

People were concerned that my 'time ' was finally coming , but I simply shook my head and said `` Trust me , it ca n't be 'coming ' . '' After all , I should 've already died , right ? Maybe I was a spirit , having some kind of crazy hallucination of still being alive when in reality nobody could see or hear me . <newline> <newline> <newline> My confliction with the subject got worse and worse .

I wanted to tell everybody that I was fine , that I could n't possibly be dying . My bed was n't my bed , the stool in front of the kitchen table was , where I drank and drank , wrote and wrote . At some point I did n't have any lead left , and just scratched across the papers with an invisible bit of graphite . And in those faint , winking hours of the morning , from days to weeks , months to years , I could see myself getting older , weaker . But I was n't dying . <newline> <newline> I searched my soul deep inside , to find a pit . An empty spot where I had once been alive .

{"question": "You are brought forward in time by freedom fighters , in order to stop an evil dictator from taking over the world . When you ask why they chose you to help them , they explain that the dictator is your future self .", "answer": "A five dollar latte and some shitty gluten free granola bar at the Grindhouse . This was the meal Emanuel had chosen after his late afternoon pretend to exercise exhaustion . So plain was the interior of this hipster inspired dive that the cups were Disney hand-me-downs from the owners mother . With them faded images of gallant knights , cute animals and princesses with hair and hips that confirm its our fault our daughters are so messed up . As the scalding arabica hit Emanuel 's lips he felt a sudden tinge in his spine . A cold chill known only to those who have played their Deja Vu over and over until the reality of their existence and faliciy of their minds began to muddle . Normally he would think nothing of it , attribute it to having those lousy discount running shoes and trot along home to pound a drink and a pillow . Not today though , today was the unfortunate day where a tinge along the discs would become manifest in an idea . So simple most have thought it and tucked it away in a pit as to not challenge the fragile chains we have so painfully constructed around our lives , the noose that keeps us in line . Today was the day he took his fathers Beretta 418 and painted his apartment in red relief . He would put it in his mouth , close his eyes and quietly go into the dark that had already consumed so many other suburbanites . Or perhaps he would point it at his temple and scream as his Norse ancestors did before they enacted the blood toll on the early Christians . In an instant he would be dead and either facing his god or simply ceasing to be anything . <newline> With no need to race home Emanuel began to stroll into the `` nice '' part of town . It was not the seedy underpass of his youth , with preteen hookers looking to score and junkies looking to die . Nor was the the upscale gardens where he worked curating some of the finest food in the city for what had to be the worst people on the planet . With every amuse-bouche wasted on pallets not better then the puntable dogs they carried he felt his talents wasted on those who cared more that the food was expensive then it was good . He once bought a craze case and garnished with rotten kale to serve at a governors private party . A little wine paired with self delusion and all the members believed they were in on the hottest new culinary craze . No , this was the working class `` brown shingles '' as he had come to name them . Unkempt sidewalks and yellow grass rings marked those with the young children . Halloween decorations up in March and against HOA marked the old ones . A place whos name was so generic a gps had a qualifier before you could find it . Where families come to exist and nothing more . <newline> It was quiet . To say it was silent would be a lie , there existed sound to remind Emanuel he was not in a nightmare . That sound though was foreign to the criteria of his working class neighborhood . No kids running around playing war as Fox news had taught them . No teens claiming they are moving to Canada due to the distressing nature of American healthcare they have never once paid into or even considered . No the sounds were much more empty , as if made by one who knew deception required noise but knew nothing of this place . After feeling euphoric in his decision all day , for the first time in years he felt fear .

{"question": "You live in two different universes . Each time you go to sleep in one , you wake up in the other . Now that it 's your 18th birthday , you must choose one .", "answer": "In my favorite life , I lived in a castle . Not a dreary actual-fortification kind of castle with arrow slits for windows , but a beautiful , honest-to-God fairytale castle with brightly-painted towers and stained glass windows . Every morning I would wake up in my room at the top of one of those towers . The sunlight would fall on my face in many-colored patterns , and the smell of freshly-baked sweetcakes would greet me from my bedside table . There was always a set of clothes laid out at the foot of the bed . <newline> <newline> The castle and the countryside were mine to explore . Some days , I wandered through the castle , knowing the layout by heart and yet somehow always finding new rooms containing new wonders , even though I had wandered the castle 's halls on thousands of other days . Other days , I explored the countryside . Rolling green hills seemed to go on infinitely beneath an always-perfect blue sky . Streams flowed down those hills into shady groves of trees . <newline> <newline> But eventually , the sun would begin to wane , and I would begin to grow tired . I became apprehensive as the lengthening shadows of the trees or the furniture seemed to want to reach out and grab me . But I knew that I would always be safe in my tower room , so I would go there , and eventually fall asleep in my bed . <newline> <newline> In my not-so-favorite life , I lived in the other castle . At least , I assumed it was a castle . The dungeon of a castle , to be specific . The walls were not stone , like my real home , but a drab off-white plaster of some kind . The single door was made of dully-reflective metal , with a thick window that contained a crosshatched wire . The door was strong ; I could never open it . I wore simple clothes of the same off-white color as the walls . <newline> <newline> It was always dark in this castle , and that scared me . There was one window in my room , at least , and I could look out without having to leave the safety of my bed . The window overlooked a lake ; I would watch the water for hours . The water would move in predictable , orderly patterns , and I would slowly become less afraid . Sometimes it was clear and I could see the stars , which always made me happy . Sometimes , it was cloudy , and I could n't see anything . Those nights were long . Sometimes , it would storm , and rain and wind would slam into my window , and I would curl up tighter in my bed and cry and wish I could just fall asleep and go back home . <newline> <newline> On nights when I could see , after hours of looking out the window , the horizon would begin to lighten and I would stretch and strain against my tiredness to stay awake , and almost stay awake long enough to see the sun , but inevitably , I fell asleep and returned to my tower room . <newline> <newline> Still other nights , maybe one in five , I would have a visitor . A face would appear in the crosshatched window , watch me for a minute , then the door would open . The man would walk in and spin around my room 's one chair to face me and sit down . He always wore loosely fitting blue clothes and carried a stack of papers . I would never move from my curled-up position on my bed , and he would always smile at me , as if waiting for something . <newline> <newline> `` I 've been thinking about what you told me about the tower , '' he said , his voice low and steady . `` You told me that it 's better there because it 's always light , right ? '' <newline> <newline> I nodded . <newline> <newline> `` And it 's always dark here ? '' He asked , looking into my eyes . <newline> <newline> I hunched down more and nodded again . Tonight was a clear night , and the stars were out , and the sky was beginning to get lighter , and I wished he would just go away . Maybe this time I could stay awake , if I really tried . <newline> <newline> He sighed . `` You know , I 've told you before that you would eventually have to choose . That choice is entirely up to you to make . But I have one question for you , my friend . '' <newline> <newline> He paused until I looked up at his face again . <newline> <newline> `` Would you rather stay in a place where you are always afraid of the night ?

{"question": "You have just successfully prevented a zombie apocalypse . By killing the first one to turn . What you call `` heroism '' the police call `` murder '' .", "answer": "I crouched down , and dropped the bloody spade in my hand upon the perfectly manicured lawn below me . A bead of sweat slowly trickled down my forehead , and I struggled to regain my breath , desperately sucking in air while my head throbbed with pain . <newline> <newline> In front of me , the pale corpse that had tried to eat my brains , laid upon the grass in a twisted heap . Her crushed head and broken neck had swung backwards , and had been pinned underneath her withering body as she had fallen to the ground . Now her gnashing teeth were no longer snapping at me , I stood up and slowly shuffled forward for a better look . <newline> <newline> As I came within reach of the zombie 's legs , I kicked her shoe , to check for a sign of life . Observing none , I stepped around to take in a full view of the dead woman ; the sight of it evoked the image of a dead deer in a black-and-white movie , with her pallid skin tone , a tattered , dirty brown fur coat partially covering her upper body , muddy and worn-out black shoes giving the impression of hooves . She looked frail , and old , despite her startling speed and vice-grip strength that had been exhibited when she had chased me out of the pathology lab I had been sitting in . Luckily that spade had been leaning against a house out in the open , or ... <newline> <newline> The sudden realisation of what had happened , what I had been caught up in , made me retreat to my inner sanctuary , the place where my thoughts and fantasies collided . Had I really been attacked by , and killed , a zombie ? When faced with life or death , had I survived by using my own wits , or through dumb luck ? I was feeling more tired and jaded as every question tumbled over and over in my mind . <newline> <newline> Just as a feeling of catatonia was beginning to descend over my shoulders and into my chest , the rapidly approaching sounds of sirens broke the spell . Upon realising that I had sunk to my knees next to the zombie , I snapped into a tall stance , and spun around . The sirens were blaring from three police cars , lights flashing and wheels screeching as they rounded the corner at the end of the street . <newline> <newline> My first thought was , thank goodness - and I began to slowly walk towards the vehicles , who all stopped suddenly in the middle of the lane . A nagging feeling started pulling at my collar , accompanied by confusion and a hint of dread . <newline> <newline> The passenger side front door on the closest car swung open first , and a police officer sprung out , pistol in hand and pointed at my head . Four more officers from the other two cars immediately did the same thing , and the driver of the closest car climbed out with a megaphone in hand . My hands automatically went out in front of me , palms facing the cars . *They think you killed her* , I thought for a moment - and my heart began to race , as the reality of the situation dawned on me . <newline> <newline> ** '' HANDS ON YOUR HEAD , AND DOWN ON YOUR KNEES ! ! ! `` ** shouted the megaphone-wielding officer in the foremost car , and the officers moved out from behind their car doors , guns still trained on me . All of them walked towards me , and the man furthest to the right reached behind his back to grab a pair of handcuffs , all while shuffling closer to me . I meekly submitted , dropping to my knees with my fingers interlocked behind my head . The coarse stones of the driveway I had stopped upon , stabbed into my knees , and I winced from the pain . <newline> <newline> The officers closed the rest of the distance at a jog , and the handcuff-wielding officer quickly attached the cuffs to my left arm . He grabbed my arms , twisted them down firmly , and completed the cuffing . Once that was done , they all bolstered their weapon , and tears began to form in my eyes - I could n't hold on , as the gravity of what was happening started sinking in . <newline> <newline> The final officer , who had dispensed with his megaphone , walked up to me as two of the policemen lifted me to my feet . His face was like black thunder , a sharp , dark , twisted stone facade that showed the hard and horrifying life he had been living , as well as the pity and revulsion he clearly held for me . <newline> <newline> He kept it simple , in a tone that sounded like how his face looked - thunderous . <newline> <newline> `` You are under arrest , for the murder of Betty White .

{"question": "The stray cats in your neighborhood have been oddly industrious lately . Curious , you follow one to an abandoned lot and find what appears to be a crude spaceship .", "answer": "Before I start this story , I would just like to say I do n't mean any cats any harm . I really do n't - I mean , come on , I 'm practically one of them . Some people even call me catty . Even if I do n't quite get catcalls . <newline> <newline> Yes , I *am* a guy . <newline> <newline> My name is Jaymes - yes , my parents chose to spell it with a `` y '' , because well , `` y '' not ? Eh , eh ? No ? <newline> <newline> Okay , anyway . This story begins on an ordinary Tuesday night , just like this one . All week , I had been noticing the stray cats snooping around , moving quite a bit both in the day and at night . Something was brewing - I just assumed it was some sort of cat-turf war or a great Wild Cat Hunt for some rats . So , I decided to follow one particular cat I had fed once or twice . <newline> <newline> The cat had fur that was a brownish hue , like the sort you 'd find on wood or chocolate . The sort that seemed just too beautiful for nature to produce . Though that might have just been the dirt . I stalked - or , well , tried to stalk - closely behind it , ducking left and right behind walls like I had seen people do in all the shows and games . And every time I did this , I thought to myself with an imaginary fist pump , `` Juked ! '' <newline> <newline> It probably noticed me but continued onward anyway . Slowly , towards an abandoned parking lot , which was barely used even in its heyday , but now laid in a state of discard and disrepair . A few trees had somehow taken root in the worn out cracks of the old cement and concrete surface , brute forcing their way out of the black asphalt in a startlingly violent manner . How did it even grow here ? <newline> <newline> It was then that I noticed , through the tiny gaps in the leafy cape that formed the canopy , the blueish black sky that spoke quietly of the night 's arrival . I had gotten too caught up in following the cat . Speaking of which - <newline> <newline> The cat was not too far from where I was , having continued its agonizingly slow pace . It walked up to some odd machine - wait , is that a spaceship ? - I thought with a great amount of disbelief . I wo n't lie , I really had to take a moment and think just how much I had smoked in the afternoon to be seeing a *spaceship* in broad day - well , night-darkness but it might as well have been daylight for the cats . I had thought the cats were being unusually industrious lately ; I just never thought they had an aerospace industry of some sort . <newline> <newline> The brownish cat squatted beside the spaceship and seemed to take a shit . It must have been some severe constipation but eventually , a dry bag of screws came out . Ironically , the cat was n't rusty at keeping the metal screws clean . It licked itself clean afterwards and then stared right at me with glazed eyes that hinted at sentient arrogance . <newline> <newline> I did n't stay around to watch after that . Yes , I outran a genius cat and his companions all the way back home . It was a close and tough fight , filled with all the exciting twists and turns you might expect from a show like Game of Thrones . But I made it .

Her mother protested , but she did not listen . Her father shook her head , but it did n't matter .

She put on a leather jerkin and her father 's over-sized pants , and she left the house . <newline> <newline> In the forest , it snowed gently . Her footsteps were light and the marks were deep , so she could be followed . Soon , a monkey approached her . <newline> <newline> 'Where are you going ?

His early life was filled with countless experiences that made it abundantly clear his role would not be cast as an adventuring warrior .

So , when he finally grew tall enough to see over the counter , he went down to the local Quaff 'N Carry and asked Mordika the Blessed for a job . <newline> <newline> To all those who arrived at Quaff 'n Carry , Mordika looked every bit the part of a sage mage and wizened shopkeeper .

There was n't the sound of his records , repeating themselves over and over on the old record player , never skipping a beat . He always did take good care of his records , the woman thought . He would certainly have been upset to see them collecting dust in the corner of the living room . But she could never work up the will to play them . Too many memories . <newline> She held in her hand the locket that he had given her the day he went to Okinawa . It was all she had to remember him by during the fighting during the war , so she treasured it like it were a piece of her heart . <newline> In this sense , she felt it really was . Even now , though Hugh had passed on , she never really felt alone .

'' Laura whispered to herself . She picked herself up from her chair and walked over to the records . There was a record that he would always listen to , she thought to herself .

{"question": "You live in a world where each lie creates a scar on the liar 's body . The bigger the lie , the deeper and larger the mark . One day , you meet someone that only has one scar ; it is the biggest one you have ever seen .", "answer": "I pass the open door of my favourite cafe , a warm plume of caramel scented air greets me , inviting me and pulling me off the cold winter street . I let myself get carried over to the bar , expecting to see the usual waiter ; a burly man in his 40s wearing the usual faded suit jacket and dark jeans . As I look up , my breath is plucked from my lungs . I are n't greeted by the thinning blond hair and piercing blue eyes I expected , but a girl . Soft hair , brown and untamed cascaded over her shoulders on to the pristine white shirt and onto her bust . Everything seems to be in slow motion as my eyes trace every contour and shape of her body in detail . Unlike me , or any of the other customers , who 's hands are littered with small flecks of white , which was the cost of keeping face in today 's society , she was completely pure . From her head to her toes , not a single blemish on her silk skin . She is the definition of beautiful . Her delicate , porcelain hands clasped together in front of that short black dress , which is formal but still very attractive . Green eyes flicked up with a look of coy and curiosity as a faint smile worked it 's way onto her soft peach lips . I blush . Her voice resonated into my mind , cutting off my thought . Matching her appearance , her words are softly spoken and sweet . The type of voice that reminds you of home . <newline> <newline> `` Hi , my name 's Mei . What are you ordering today , sir '' she asks with enthusiasm . <newline> `` Uh ... a.. '' I fumble through my speech like a nervous child on his first day of school `` A number 7 please '' I falter for a moment after realizing my mistake . There is no number 7 on the menu . <newline> <newline> As soon as the words leave me , her eyes narrow . The persona of before has left her and now , all I can think of is danger . She asks me to follow her in a quick and monotone voice . That voice reminded me of a killer . Her speech and her walking pattern , as she walks through to a separate room is ruthless and efficient . No wasted movement . I follow nervously , almost tripping over myself and take a seat opposite her in the exquisitely decorated room I now find myself in . A square table , wooden and stained dark , separates us . <newline> <newline> `` So Mr.. Hudson . You requested a model 23 , complete organ transplants . You 've transferred 14 million , half of the payment and were ready to begin . '' <newline> <newline> I do n't understand . I 'm panicking . Did she just say organ transplant ? I desperately try to think of a way out of this situation but I 'm distracted by the sight of Mei taking her formal shirt off to reveal a very thin , white top underneath . She looks so damn perfect . I 've gained momentary relief from my panic just by the mere sight of her . That 's when the real Mr Hudson walks in . He is very old and withered , covered in long , deep scars , spiralling across his body . He must be about 80 , and he speaks with a dry , raspy voice . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm here to see Mei '' <newline> <newline> he says almost innocently . Mei walks to meet him and that 's when I see it . A huge , deep purple scar under the thin shirt she 's wearing , swimming from the top of her neck all the way down to the small of her back , and then way past where I can see . She approaches him calmly whispers something in his ear . He raises and eyebrow and they both smile . My sense of danger kicks in again , and adrenaline starts to course through my veins . I get it now . <newline> <newline> `` Now then sir , as you are probably aware , there has been a confusion between you and Mr Hudson here '' she says gesturing to the old man with an open palm . <newline> <newline> She does n't have to tell the truth like the rest of us . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't worry sir . '' She walks towards me with a smile . A smile of malice . <newline> <newline> That 's not her body . <newline> <newline> `` You 're going to be just fine .

{"question": "When everyone turns 18 , they receive a pet which is figurative of their personality . You 're the first person to receive a dragon ...", "answer": "We are only what we make of ourselves in this world , nothing more . <newline> <newline> Some people aspire to greatness , while others wallow in the misery of their own innate inadequacy . Most accomplish nothing in their lives , content to only do what is easy . They never grow , never push their limits . And in the end , they never amount to much . <newline> <newline> In most worlds , this is a common - if often hidden - truth . People are lazy , never wanting to become all that they can be , and they hide behind masks of adequacy for the duration of their pitiful lifespan . There are no obvious markers , no signposts indicating that any given person is a slaking bottom feeder . No way of telling the great from the pitiful , at least not until all is said and done . No judgement until the Judgement . <newline> <newline> Here , it is different . <newline> <newline> In my world , everyone knows who and what everyone else is . Nothing is hidden , and once you are marked you are marked for life . Here , on the 18th anniversary of our first breath , our nature manifests itself and separates from our flesh for all to see forever more . <newline> <newline> You see , on our 18th birthdays , down to the minute , a ... change occurs . A portion of our bodies changes instantly , rapidly becoming the animal or being most becoming our personality . The slugs and bottom feeders have familiars that are just that : Slimy , crawling eaters of shit that do nothing but clean the refuse from the boots of mankind . Their slime is worn on their sleeves , and no one ever gives them the time of day . Worse still are the leeches and tics , the ones who actively draw on the resources of their fellow man . While some keep their familiars hidden , I suspect more than one politician has a tapeworm that they do n't want anyone to find out about . <newline> <newline> Some try to kill their familiar , to hide their true nature , or even to simply run away . Of course , such attempts are futile , causing the creature to manifest anew ... which as I was about to find out was NOT a pleasant experience . <newline> <newline> As I woke on my 18th birthday , my belly was full the fire of change . Today was the critical day that would decide my fate . I knew I was better . I am superior than these pitiful people that call themselves my `` family . '' My mother had me before she manifested , calling forth a pitiful mouse . True to her kind , she had another on the way before I was even 2 . And no father to be seen . Of course . <newline> <newline> My little brother was staring at me wide eyed at breakfast . He was only a few years younger than I was , but his naivety was expressed in his every movement . I bet he will be something pitiful . Maybe a deer . If he changes his outlook and becomes a bit more curious maybe he will get a fox . Then , he could at least appear as a predator instead of prey . Not that he could make much of it anyway . <newline> <newline> `` Hi big bro . Are you going to school today ? '' He plaintively asked . <newline> <newline> `` Damn little bro , could your eyes get any bigger ? '' I sneered . `` You are going to end up with one of those little nocturnal monkeys on your shoulder . Or those fish in the deep ocean . You do n't want to have to drag around an oarfish , do you ? '' He was so pitiful . So innocent . So ... useless . Why did I have to be born into this family of weaklings ? <newline> <newline> My mother , 8 months pregnant ( AGAIN ) finally pulled her girth around the doorway from the bedroom . She looked like she wanted to say something about the way I was treating my brother , but could n't work up the courage to put the words together . Damn this place is pitiful . I shot her a sneer and said `` Nah little bro , I 'm not . It 's my 18th , no one has any obligations on their 18th . You know that . '' Dumbass . People like him get chewed up and spit out . `` I 'm gon na hit the town . Got ta live it up with some real folks before I lose my shit . See ya ! '' I twisted my body out of my chair and made a beeline to the door .

Tools . That was the thing that elevated humanity from mere beasts . And these celestial foes ... They did n't have the drive to craft anything .

There are many things you can do to help you be a more good at this, but there is so much that is not happening that you don't want to work with anyone. If you think you have been told you will get hurt, you will be fine. But the problem is that you do not want to get hurt, you have to make the best of the situation, and it is important to try to make things better. If you can't get help then go to your doctor and see if it is possible to get a better treatment. You will be able to get help if you are not happy with the way you treated yourself and the family. You need to have enough medication and the doctor will know how to treat you, and this is where you need to find help. For that, you will need to get help from your doctor and help you get some help. If you have a lot of problems that will take your life, you will need to seek medical attention. You need to get the treatment you need to get help if you need it. If you are still not sure what to do, get in touch with your doctor. You may have to find a doctor who will do the job for you, but it is a bit of work, so don't use it. Don't get upset if you get hurt. This is just a bad idea and you should be good to go. If you want to get help with a criminal case, you can always ask your doctor for help in case it is too serious. This is because of the fact that you don't need help for everyone. It is important that you always know what you are going through. Even though you need to be supportive and caring, you should be able to talk to them before you talk to them, and make them aware of what you are doing. If you are in a group or any other kind of trouble, you should talk to someone who has experienced this. You need to talk to them about how they can help you and if they are getting hurt. It is possible that you are dealing with some kind of medical issue, and if you are concerned about them, you should take that into consideration.

{"question": "Humans have the opportunity to never feel sadness or pain again , but in order to do so must offer up a sacrifice : one person to become immortal and experience only misery for the rest of eternity .", "answer": "It was a beautiful day . <newline> <newline> Rain beat down on the windowsills of Jeffrey 's apartment bedroom . He lived on the 66th floor of the Grand Luxury Ulysses , which was n't particularly luxurious or grand when compared to many of the other surrounding skyscraping condominiums . This was a good thing . It allowed him to strive for more in life . In the meantime , the view was fantastic and the lack of a working elevator kept him in exceptional shape . Everyone in the building liked it like this , so the repairmen never saw the need to bother fixing it . <newline> <newline> Jeffrey 's father had passed not long ago . Yesterday been the funeral . He smiled as he looked at the picture of his father that he kept beside the bed . He had always depended on his father . Still , the funeral was a positive experience .

That was the nice thing about storms . They 'd always end , and the sun would always peek through . It was the sort of sight that filled you with hope and happiness .

It was The Pilgrimmage . <newline> <newline> Jeffrey met Mary outside of apartment building . He greeted her with a smile and she returned it warmly . Already the streets were beginning to fill with people making The Pilgrimmage on foot . <newline> <newline> They walked for hours , greeting people they knew and often being greeted by people they did n't . The entire thing brought everyone together in thanks for what they had . Certainly the lineup outside of The Complex would be long . Perhaps they 'd even stand in it for days . That hardly mattered . <newline> <newline> As people filed in to the massive Complex standing shoulder to shoulder five wide , they were invited down whitewash hallways by attendants wearing special hospital gowns .

It provided or activities , adventure , comfort , meals – but it , of course , was still prison-like and always in lockdown except on the day of The Pilgrimmage . <newline> <newline> Today was certainly different . Jeffrey and Mary made their way through the long corridors with the rest of the smiling pilgrims until they came upon a windowed door in a final darkened hallway . A gentle , calming music played through speakers in the ceiling . Each pilgrim would pause at the door , say a quiet prayer , then turn around and leave . Jeffrey approached the door and peered inside . <newline> <newline> Thick , padded walls . No objects . Simply a frail , skeleton of a man with a grey , haggard face and wide , bloodshot eyes sitting in the corner confined by a straightjacket . A mess of blood and hair in the midle of the floor where , even in here , it had somehow managed to injure itself . It looked straight into Jeffrey 's eyes , and opened his gagged , bloody mouth as if to let loose a terrible scream . But it could n't . The Chosen had , many years ago , become the sole receptacle of all negative emotion . Clearly it was too much for any mind to handle , and it had been twisted and tortured beyond insanity . Its head slumped momentarily , but before long a new frenzied struggle against the confinement of the straight jacket began in vain . <newline> <newline> Jeffrey felt a soft hand on his shoulder .

I had always been a bit quiet and withdrawn , so when I stopped showing up to parties , I don ’ t think anyone really noticed . They would occasionally text me to see what was up , or enquire about grabbing a meal sometime , but I always politely brushed them off by saying I was too busy and maybe we could try again another time .

It is estimated that more than 9 million deaths are preventable, and that the total number of people who died was 4 million. The data show that the total number of people affected in the United States has been reduced to 6 million. This is the third largest number of deaths in the United States. While there are tens of thousands of people in the United States who suffer from many types of diseases, as a group, only 5 million are diagnosed. This is a statistic that does not automatically explain the vast number of deaths. In 2012, the total number of people died by suicide in the United States was 7 million. The United States is the world's most populous nation, with over 2.2 million people living in urban areas. There are currently 8 million people living with a life expectancy of around 20 years, including a population of 12 million. This includes the whole of the United States, the majority of whom live in urban areas and have no access to health services, the majority of whom are minors. This is an important cause for concern for many, but also for those in the United States who cannot afford to continue living in the United States. In addition, there is a risk of death from a serious illness like cancer, heart disease, and cancer. A new report by the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that the average age of a person aged 25 years is about five years. This means that \"living on a rural or rural scale, or at least three adults, is unlikely to sustain life or prevent death from this disease.\" That said, the World Health Organization reports that around 5 million children die of acute or chronic injuries every year. Even a tiny fraction of those suffering from a chronic illness are still dying from a disease that affects their health. In the United States, the death rate is approximately 30,000 people per year, but this has increased by approximately 4 million from the same period in 2007. The impact of the death of a child is extremely limited because of the number of children, and the number of children born in the United States is small. This can be attributed to the fact that some people live in such a small and isolated area that they are unable to live independently, or to be able to afford them, and therefore do not"}

I've come across several authors who are really great writers. In this case, there's a great deal of creativity and energy to it, but it's a matter of scientific method and art. But a lot of the work is very easy to understand. It's a very clever science and the best way to say it is just a short quirk of the same story. It's not very far-fetched. I think I'm going to end up with a better case. It's a fairly good deal. So I guess. I'm not going to lay the groundwork for an experiment. But if you want to use it as a justification for not being a 'typical' scientist. You can't afford to try a lot of different things. The reason you've got to be a physicist is because you don't need to be great at it. I don't think you need to know. In fact, one of the biggest mistakes of science is that it can't be done. It's difficult... if you think about it, but the scientific method is so powerful that it can't be trusted. It's very difficult. It's a very difficult thing. You have to be careful. You must be in a position to learn. It's a great job. It's something that you can learn. It's difficult to deal with. I think that is really important. So I think that's a good way of doing things. I think there is a huge risk that the people who do science or education do not know that. That's why I'm not at all convinced. I think that scientists can learn. So I hope that helps you.

For example, the new global movement of the world, by the way, is described as a non-relational world. In fact, global problems such as the global poverty crisis and climate change, economic inequality and poverty have made the global global population and the world economy unstable. This new global reality is not an easy one, but it is a call to action for global health. This is a new world economy that has been in existence for several thousand years. The world must be resilient and stable, in a globalized world. Moreover, global health needs to be controlled and replaced. So, it is necessary to be conscious of the need for a global health state. There are many issues in the world, but it is important that the global health state is in place and has a sustainable global health state. There are different types of health crises that need to be overcome in order to be able to cope with them. This is a great opportunity to develop a holistic health and nutrition plan that is a model of the global health system. This is a global health crisis. The leading global health crisis can be seen in the recent and ongoing global health crisis. It is not just a crisis but a crisis that is driven by a global health crisis.

{"question": "Humans have sent encoded signals into space in search of extraterrestrial life . Someone , or something responded to the signals .", "answer": "I 'm not too happy with how this turned out , but I spent time on it , so you 're having it ... <newline> <newline> It has often been said that if proof of extra-terrestrial life were to land on our doorstep , mass panic would ensue . Imagine , then , the problems that would arise if beforehand it was well known that the alien life forms were hostile and regarded us as nothing more than food . When we sent signals out into space it was in the hope that we were not alone . <newline> Human kind had looked out at the stars for tens of thousands of years and wondered what they meant . Once it was known exactly what those thin points of light in the night sky actually were , that each one could hold other planets capable of life , people began to imagine that maybe , actually , we weren ’ t alone . It was theorised that any life form that became significantly advanced would have nothing but peace on its mind . <newline> The resources needed to travel the stars , and indeed the cooperation needed just to become a civilisation in the first place , should mean that species unable to cooperate peacefully would not be able to advance beyond simple tools . <newline> <newline> Which was why it was particularly distressing when we received the first , and only , extra-terrestrial response to our innocent probing . The transmission was received in two parts . The first was an unintelligible radio signal , being as it was in their own language , and experts puzzled over it for months before an object appeared in the sky . It was brightly lit and orbited the earth for three days , apparently openly sending signals back to the same point of space as the radio transmission had originated . Eventually it entered the atmosphere and crash landed in the middle of London . It stood motionless for some time in a pit of its own creation , and then it released a blast from an unknown weapon type . It destroyed every structure within a five mile radius . The type of blast was completely unknown . What we do know is that while it destroyed every building , it didn ’ t directly kill a single living thing . People were , of course , killed by collapsing buildings and flying debris , but before it had fired its unique weapon a crowd of maybe two-hundred people had gathered around it . Not one of those people died from the blast . <newline> Then it began to transmit to us . It said , in the crudest translation , that technology was forbidden , that cities were forbidden and that resistance was forbidden . It told us , in a harsh approximation of a human voice , that when the first Lander came in six months , this was where it would land . It went on for some time . It told us that we would be food and slaves . It didn ’ t say this just to the British , of course , it told the whole world . It transmitted in each region ’ s language , and it told us to surrender . <newline> <newline> Surrendering , of course , wasn ’ t what was on most people ’ s minds . The first thing most nations did , rather embarrassingly , was to recall any and all troops on foreign soil . Countries all over the world were pretty short on offerings to deal with the probe , preferring instead to prepare for the coming of the promised Landers . <newline> Bizarrely , life carried on almost like normal , at first . Rationing started up pretty quickly , and the government took ownership of all food stores around the country . Army personnel were despatched to protect these places with orders to shoot to kill . Martial law came into effect , and people went to work like they had before . The general consensus was that everything would be okay . <newline> <newline> The military started a major recruitment campaign , and indeed did very well out of it . A few times they attempted to destroy the probe with no success . It would occasionally openly transmit data about troop placements , and it would receive information back in the same garbled tongue that was their language . It appeared to know all , yet did nothing to stop any of it . Once it transmitted that huge numbers of tanks had been drawing closer to it , and that an airstrike was scheduled for later that day . <newline> The fact that it knew this information and didn ’ t bother encrypting its transmissions , or indeed bother to respond to the various military attacks , unnerved a lot of people . As time of the first Lander drew closer , people began to get worried . They started stockpiling food and fuel . There was a mass exodus to the countryside , as it was generally believed that cities would be attacked first . The government had started to rank people by importance to society . Some were even taken to secret facilities for safety . The police could no longer handle the amount of disruption as people were spread out across the countryside , and the military were called in to police the insufficiently covered areas . <newline> <newline> Crime rose sharply as people encroached onto other ’ s lands , and weapon laws were relaxed to allow the general population to own handguns .

It was n't his whining , nasal voice . No . It was his smug , self-centered attitude . Nothing was ever his fault . The mess was always `` someone else .

He was out of our lives . Thank god . Unfortunately for me , I had made no secret of how much I had hated him , and the police politely asked me to accompany them to the station .

Hell , keep your nose clean and you 'll get out even sooner . '' <newline> <newline> `` No . '' My voice was a hoarse whisper . After they had charged me , I had screamed obscenities and curses at the policemen . I felt bad about that now . They were just doing their jobs . I took a swig of water , and said it again . `` No .

The action changes only when the action changes or changes change. In the example above, the action changes after a change in the action change.

{"question": "Every left shoe on earth vanishes . society crumbles .", "answer": "`` God fucking damnit , you whore '' <newline> <newline> I hate it when he talks like that . <newline> <newline> `` Fuck '' <newline> <newline> I looked down and I examined . Two right shoes , one of them not fitting . <newline> <newline> `` They wo n't fucking let me into 7-11 , I have n't had a cigarette all god damn day . '' <newline> <newline> This was true -- 7-11 had already closed 249 stores in the past 3 months , due to their strict `` No shoes , no service . '' policy . They had refused to change the policy , the CEO quoted as saying the `` outstanding integrity of our policies is immeasurably valuable '' and `` We believe in the American dream , and that dream involves matching shoes. '' . <newline> <newline> Jed was talking to the right shoe on his left foot . Jed was very angry . <newline> <newline> **Three months prior** - <newline> President Obama had passed congress 's bill to `` increase the value of all left shoes by 20,000 % '' , on April 1st 2014 . The same day , during a presidential speech on environmental ethics at the University of Wisconsin , Obama took a gunshot to his left temple . The shooter 's name was Joji Iokana , a Korean exchange student studying to be a mechanical engineer . He had been promptly killed seconds after firing the shot at the U.S. president . It was later found out that Joji Iokana was a severely deranged individual , who had trended incredibly high on the autism spectrum . This resulted in the exchange student never actually understanding any jokes and `` reacting violently when facing sarcasm '' said Judy Iokana , his mother . The announcement to veto and destroy the bill was set for only two hours after the U.S. president had died , but never actually happened . Now , this is where congress had fucked up very badly , because they thought it would be extra funny to add a clause to the Constitution of the United States stating that the bill would `` only be destroyable by the 2014 president of the United States of America '' . Due to the immense difficulty it is to remove a clause from the constitution , congress was stuck in a tough spot even three months later , with nearly no progress made to reform the clause . The bill survived , and the United States was in an extreme state of class separation . People sold their left shoes to the rich , who hoarded them all . People stole left shoes from each other , while the rich laughed . People killed other people for their left shoes , and other people would kill those people , and so on . Even shoes in other countries became scarce , as the poor would sell their left shoes to the rich people of their homeland , who would sell them to rich men in the United States for an enormous profit . <newline> <newline> Jed threw his shoe , which was a red and nameless knock-off with white laces , at the television set . <newline> <newline> `` Today 's story , the new Yeezy-boost 63-6281 's now cost 30,000,000usd per left shoe , and 1,500 per right .

{"question": "An actually competent henchman manages to kill the superhero .", "answer": "Rancho Cucamonga was a crappy suburb in L.A. filled with ranch style homes that have 5 digit address numbers . It has strip malls , a downtown , and plenty of parking everywhere you look . Like most L.A. suburbs , it has its share of crime , but what sets Rancho Cucamunga apart is that it has its very own self-proclaimed super villain . He called himself The Heretic and he terrorizes the town by robbing liquor stores and marijuana dispensaries . He and his henchmen also like to tear through the neighborhood on their loud cars and set off other people 's car alarms . The Heretic wore a dark costume with a black cape and a pointed hood . He and his henchmen liked to wear a big `` H '' on their chest . <newline> <newline> The Heretic 's criminal activity is kept in check by a fellow with the name of Midnight Skunk , who was Rancho Cucamonga 's resident super hero . Midnight Skunk was one of these heroes that did n't really have any superpowers , other than being in really good shape and doing all sorts of martial arts . He did at one point have the ability to spray a foul odor out of the tail of his costume , but some residents complained and he had to drop it . He still likes the tail , however , and wears it with his black and white costume when he fights crime . <newline> <newline> These two have been feuding for almost 5 years when it was suddenly brought to a tragic end . It happened one day when The Heretic and his crew were trying to rob a marijuana dispensary for the drugs and the money . There were five of them ; The Heretic brought along 4 men as backup . Three of his men had been long time associates but the fourth man was brand new . The new guy was not allowed to carry a gun and was supposed to be the get away driver . He waited outside while the robbery was going down . <newline> <newline> Inside the dispensary , The Heretic had all the customers and workers tied up with duct tape . His three henchmen were looting the place . As The Heretic began to gloat and terrorize the hostages , in jumps the Midnight Skunk ! <newline> <newline> `` Fear not , citizens ! It is I , the Midnight Skunk here to rescue you ! '' the superhero said . He began fighting with The Heretic 's men . The Heretic was a small man who was no good in fights . He stood back and gathered the money and loot . Somehow , Midnight Skunk was able to get a jump on all three of his henchmen and disarm them before they could get a single shot off . The terrified hostages looked on with amazement . As they kept fighting , The Heretic made his way to the getaway vehicle . <newline> <newline> As he approached the door , he saw his fourth henchmen approaching . <newline> <newline> `` Are you alright , boss ? '' he said . `` I saw the Midnight Skunk ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Get back in the car ! '' The Heretic said , `` I told you to stay in there ! '' <newline> <newline> Just then the fight between Midnight Skunk and The Heretic 's henchmen spilled onto the street . The fourth henchman reached into his pants and brought out a 9mm pistol . He fired two shots at the Midnight Skunk and hit him in the chest and stomach . The Midnight Skunk screamed , dropped , and did not get back up again . The other three henchmen were stunned . <newline> <newline> `` You fool ! '' The Heretic said , `` Get in the car and get out of here now ! '' <newline> <newline> They all escaped in their getaway vehicle and did not stop until they were back in their hideout . All during the drive , The Heretic did n't say a word . He remained silent until they were sure no one was following them . <newline> <newline> `` You were n't supposed to have a gun ! '' The Heretic said . <newline> <newline> `` What ? I thought you 'd be happy ! I finally got that Skunk ! '' the new henchman said . <newline> <newline> The other henchmen looked down and The Heretic sighed . He began to explain to the new henchman why he was so upset . As it turns out , The Heretic and Midnight Skunk had been cooperating . Each time Midnight Skunk stopped one of The Heretic 's robberies , they would put on a fight , but Midnight Skunk would always let the criminals get away . In exchange , The Heretic and his men would not hurt the superhero and this allowed Midnight Skunk to keep fighting crime and selling his action figures . It was beneficial for both because the police generally stayed out of their feud . Now , everything was ruined . <newline> <newline> The Heretic pulled out revolver from his holster and pointed it at the new henchman . The others did the same with their guns . <newline> <newline> `` Wait , please , I 'm sorry , please give me another chance ! I 'll do anything ! '' the man begged . <newline> <newline> `` Anything ? '' The Heretic said . `` We need a new Midnight Skunk . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh ... Okay ... '' the man said . A look of hope entered his eyes . <newline> <newline> `` Hmm ... . yes , maybe you can be the new superhero in our little arrangement '' The Heretic said . `` We got ta think of a name", "pre": ".. but he is not the most well-rounded hero in this film.

At one point the villain is told by the hero to go to the police station and make sure the police are still there. The villain is never mentioned, but the man's will is just as important. In the movies the hero is used as a leader, and the hero does not kill the other villains. In the superhero movie, the hero is used to protect the hero. In the superhero movie, the hero is used to kill the hero and as such it is very important to keep him safe. In the superhero movie, the hero is the villain, and the hero is also the hero. The hero is always a man, but there are also some bad ones. There are bad guys, and the villains are very bad, and the hero is able to go to the wrong place. The hero is the only one who is blindsided by the villain, and the hero is a selfish, hopeless man who is afraid to ask the villain.

{"question": "Something invisible lives in your home . You try to expose it without letting it know that you 're aware of its presence .", "answer": "At exactly 3:32 PM on a regular old Tuesday in a regular old house on a regular old street , there was a thud that broke the boring and empty silence . This alarming sound was promptly proceeded by a series of scampering thuds , which to Albert Tinney sounded suspiciously like the footfalls of children . *Odd* , Albert thought , *I don ’ t have any children* . <newline> <newline> With a sigh and a grumble , Albert threw off his bedsheet , swung his feet out of bed and toed them into his bunny slippers . *Better not be that damned cat again* , Albert continued thinking , *or I ’ ll give it the boot . I don ’ t care what Miss Alice says* . <newline> <newline> Miss Alice was Alice Wendy , Albert ’ s neighbor and she lived with a number of cats . One cat in particular did not fancy its owner much and would continually try to break out of her house and into his . It wasn ’ t that they liked each other very much , the cat and Albert , but they did have one thing very much in common : they loved nothing more than the quiet of solitude . <newline> <newline> On many an afternoon , Al would come downstairs for a glass of milk only to find the cat curled up in the window nook above the front door . When the realtor had sold him this particular condo , he had been in quite a hurry and hadn ’ t been listening when the realtor had chimed in about the previous owner ’ s having had a pet cat — one which loved to sit and bask in the sun in its favorite spot . <newline> <newline> The trouble was , as Al soon found out , there was no cat to be found . He looked in the usual spots , upstairs and down , the beast would choose to laze around , but came up empty . *One day , I ’ m going to find out how that beast finds its way in and that ’ ll be the end of that* , he thought , nodding assuredly to himself . <newline> <newline> Then he heard it again , and froze where he stood . *Thump-thump-thump* His eyes narrowed as he climbed the stairs toward the sound . *Got you now , beastie , * he thought , smiling to himself . At the top of the stairs , he grabbed the empty laundry basket he kept near the linen cupboard . <newline> <newline> *Thump-thump-thump-thump* <newline> <newline> It was in the guest room . Of that , he was sure . On feet whisper-quiet in their tread , he crept toward the guest room door which was cracked open . Albert always kept the doors in his house closed . He found silence was easier to maintain this way . A door opened a crack should have signaled to him that something else might have been going on , because as any human with half a brain knows , only the smartest of cats know how to turn a door knob . If only Albert had been blessed with half the wit of a normal man . <newline> <newline> He held the laundry basket upside-down in one hand , ready to plop it down on an unwelcomed feline visitor , and reached for the door with the other . Not wanting to spend a beautifully boring afternoon trapsing through his house chasing after some beast , Albert wanted to get this over with nice and quick . <newline> <newline> As he reached for the door , ready to whip it open , he heard the thumps again — this time heading toward the door and he nimbly backed out of the way , careful not to bump anything and clamped his hand over his mouth as *something* — though he wasn ’ t sure what — whipped open the door and thudded its way down the hall toward his bedroom . <newline> <newline> The only trouble was that the thing wasn ’ t a *thing* at all . In fact , there didn ’ t seem to be anything there . Albert would have thought himself imagining all this nonsense if only there weren ’ t the little footprints in the dust . He noticed them now . They were partially obscured by the sweeping steps of his bunny slippers , but he was grateful now for the fact that he only dusted on odd Sundays . <newline> <newline> Oddly , the footsteps led into three rooms now and seemed to begin in the middle of the hallway as if out of no where . Albert frowned down at the footprints but decided not to make his brain hurt with plausibilities . Instead , he decided he should go in after it and try to catch it . He stood listening for a moment and heard the quick little steps of the thing in his room . Careful to close the guestroom door , he padded his way toward his bedroom door which also now stood ajar . <newline> <newline> Albert pushed gently on the door and it swung soundlessly open . Looking around , he saw nothing but remembered the beastie was invisible — at least for the moment — and thought to look down at its tracks . He followed them , his laundry basket in tow , one at a time until he came to the edge of his bed where they seemed to disappear underneath . <newline> <newline> As he was about to lean down to get a better look at things under the bed , a light bulb went off . *Best not expose my face . I ’ ll catch the bugger when it saunters out , * he thought and smirked to himself .", "pre": "It was a very strange thing to do.

But the first time I tried to live with that I had a car sitting in the street. I had to leave. I took a picture of the house with it, and I was told to stop. At the time, I thought it was a car. I didn't want to go back. I was also worried that it would take me longer to get my car back. I was very surprised. I think that my family, friends, and my wife were aware that I was never going to be a home, and I had no desire. I had also taken a look around. I was afraid that I had too much money. I had already paid for the house. When I got home. I did not want to leave. I had to take out the car and I had to make the home too small. I also had to go to the market. It was so hard to keep my house. I think that I had to take the chance that I would have to move to a new house. I didn't want to get away from it. I didn't want to leave.

The only light emits from the monitor , reflecting off the man 's black rimmed glasses , which showed a counter dropping in seconds . A list of names filled the left side of the screen in a single column . The counter was nearing 0 . The man sat up in his seat a little more . He holds his hand over a button sitting in front of the screen . He watches closely as the number counts down . 3..2..1 ... <newline> <newline> As soon as the counter reaches 1 , a quiet *ding* rings from the computer 's speakers . The counter resets at 60 and begins counting down again . The names on the left move down one . The man relaxes in his seat . He blinks twice , rapidly , bringing up information on his glass lenses . The time reads 5:59 A.M . He turns and looks behind him to a door on the opposite wall as if he were anticipating it to open . <newline> <newline> The counter drifts close to 0 again , causing the man to turn back to the monitor .

Everyone in the class bolted upright suddenly , shocked out of their hot summer afternoon schoolroom stupor at the spectacle of a teacher vanishing into thin air . I was shocked too .

Somehow the friction of Josh ’ s barely closed hand kept the drink from diving to the ground to spill its sticky contents on to the rug . It was not a beer however . The contents of the bottle were of a more innocent nature . The root beer bottle was nearly empty and only the tiniest of sips remained . His left elbow rested on his knee , with his hand supporting his head . It looked like Josh had been in nearly the same position for hours . It had , in fact , been approximately four hours . On the opposite side of the narrow hall sat Monty . Monty sat in a similar position , though he did not have a drink . <newline> Both of his elbows rested on his knees , pulling them slightly apart .

Monty ignored the forgotten text message he had gotten from his girlfriend hours ago . He turned the phone around to show the other two . 4:03 . They all had classes in the morning and each knew they should ’ ve gone to bed hours ago . <newline> Josh was the next to break the stillness . Using the wall as his support he slowly got up . He looked down at the other two for a brief moment , making eye contact with both . They all understood . Josh slowly turned around and walked away from them . He stumbled ever so slightly , whether from exhaustion or standing up after sitting down for so long . He made it to the end of the hall and pushed the door open , disappearing out of sight into the dark room . Monty and Garret only looked at each other for a split second before following suit . Monty got up quickly and helped Garret up . They quietly walked down the hall , in the opposite direction of Josh . Garret reached his room first and Monty passed him . Each went into their respective rooms . Garret knew he had to be up in three hours . He didn ’ t care . It had been a good night . <newline>", "pre": ". No final decision.

Your username . Write how it terrorizes humans .", "answer": "In these troubled times , there are many creatures to fear . Some are the terrifying beasts we have long heard of in myths and legends . Others were too insane for humane beings to imagine , and one glimpse at their forms induced incurable madness . And yet others still seemed harmless at first , yet proved to be some of the most dangerous of all . The Party Porpoise falls in that last category . <newline> <newline> What makes the Party Porpoise so feared is that it does n't just kill you in a terrible way . No , it takes something we all used to love and twists it into something horrible . The Party Porpoise , when it first appeared , seemed friendly .

A neverending party gets old quickly . The Party Porpoise 's boom box entices you to dance for weeks on end . The only respite is when you drop dead from exhaustion . At first , rescue forces wearing earplugs would attempt to get people away from the sound , but the Party Porpoise would turn up the volume until it could pierce even the best earplugs .

{"question": "You are a dog who is trying to kill its master , but the family 's cat stops you at every turn .", "answer": "Jack had a great relationship with Jenny , they had been together since he was just a pup . She always played with him , held him when there was a storm outside , and fed him the good stuff off the dinner table . None of that mattered anymore . He tried to warn her , he shouted `` Do n't think I do n't know what the V-E-T is ! Do n't take me there ! Please do n't take me to the vet ! '' But she ignored his pleas . That 's when everything changed . That 's when he knew he could n't trust Jenny . That 's when he made a commitment to himself . Once they cut Jack 's balls off , he swore he would kill Jenny for taking him to the vet . <newline> <newline> Jack had planned for this moment for weeks . He had to give himself some time to recover from his castration , build his strength back up , but today was the day . His plan was simple - wait for Jenny to fall into a deep sleep and bite his way to vengeance . Jack was not a smart dog , he knew he had to keep it simple if he was to succeed . This plan was perfect , except for one loose end : Sparkles . <newline> <newline> God damn it ... Sparkles , a furry ten pound mass of pure chaos with claws , fangs , and the sharpest senses . Sparkles did not understand that she was an unstable sociopath , and Jack understood even less of her motivations . At times , Jack and Sparkles were allies , cooperating against Jenny to get some delicious human food . Other times , they were merely roommates , not necessarily friend or foe . And yet other times Sparkles was a blood-thirsty spawn from hell with one and only one mission - to claw the ever-loving shit out of Jack 's face . This was the real crux of the problem - not the Sparkles was a known enemy , but that she was totally and utterly unpredictable . <newline> <newline> Sparkles was n't the only cat in the house . Frankie was an older tabby , who had reached the apex of apathy . Jack and Frankie had an understanding , Frankie would always say things like `` We 're cool man . You dig ? '' Jack honestly had no idea what the hell he was talking about , other than that it was positive sentiment . Frankie was infinitely more laid back than Sparkles , but at a certain cost - Frankie had been a heavy catnip user in his youth , making him relaxed but thoroughly demented . <newline> <newline> His moment had come . Jack knew Jenny 's habits well , and when she turned off the TV , he knew that she would be asleep soon . This is it , this was his opportunity . Jack just needed to wait a few minutes for Jenny to be in deep sleep and make sure Sparkles would n't interfere . <newline> <newline> `` Hey Frankie ... Psst , Frankie ! '' Jack whispered from across the living room , but got no response . Frankie was passed out hard on the top of his scratching post . Jack wanted Frankie to be a lookout - he had n't seen Sparkles for hours and worried that she would somehow ruin his plan . <newline> <newline> Jack crossed the room and nudged Frankie with his snout , whispering `` Psst ... Frankie . Get up '' <newline> <newline> `` What is it man , ca n't you see I 'm sleeping ? Killing my dreams man . '' grumbled Frankie . <newline> <newline> `` Frankie , help a brother out - just keep a look out for Sparkles , and shout if she goes towards Jenny 's room OK ? '' urged Jack . `` Can you do that for me ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , whatever man , no sweat . '' mumbled Frankie . He was already one paw back into his dream . <newline> <newline> Shit ... Jack thought , Frankie was going to be no help at all . He felt he was losing his motivation , losing his conviction to go through with his plan . Then he remembered waking up , hazy with drugs , held together with stitches , and ball-less . He shook his head and focused on the task at hand . He made his way to Jenny 's bedroom . <newline> <newline> He was angry . He had a plan . He was ready to kill . Jack started approaching Jenny 's bed , when a moment of panic hit him - there was Sparkles , sitting at Jenny 's feet . She was awake and immediately aware of the fact that Jack was there , and not for cuddles . <newline> <newline> `` Hmm hmm , Jack , what are ya doing there ? Hmm ? '' she said as her eyes twitched . This was one of Sparkles symptoms when she was in one of her batshit crazy moods . `` Still upset about the V-E-T huh ? Hahaha ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Shut up Sparkles ! '' throated Jack , `` You know why I 'm here . I 'm here to kill Jenny , and there 's nothing , nothing you can do to stop me ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , hmm , is that so ? Hmm . I think you 'll have a sudden change of heart in a moment , hmmm '' mocked Sparkles . <newline> <newline> Jack knew it was now or never .

{"question": "A kid doodling in a math class accidentally creates the world 's first functional magic circle in centuries .", "answer": "Count on me to make things complicated . Not your normal 'it 's complicated ' relationship thing , or 'its complicated ' as an excuse for an unsolved sudoku puzzle , but the kind of 'its complicated ' when you have to explain to your parents that you summoned a freaking demon in the middle of math class . My excuse ? I was bored . <newline> <newline> My third period math class had started all of five minutes ago and I was already daydreaming while absently scribbling in my notebook . Usually I would draw animals , or make some flowers , but not today . Some stupid kid had to set his dripping wet water bottle on my notes while he talked to his friends , and I could n't just leave the perfect circle made by water alone . So after telling the owner of the water bottle to do something highly anatomically unlikely , I drew in the lines of the circle myself . And I could n't leave the circle empty , so I started drawing lines . I intended for the lines to be spokes , I could turn this into an old fashioned bike or something , but it turned into some sort of star . `` Ms. Ryans , must you doodle and daydream during my lectures ? It wo n't help you on the test . '' I thought back to dear old Winston Churchill and replied , `` No , it 's purely voluntary . '' Not my best idea . Mr.Darson sighed and said , `` See me after class . '' I tried to pay attention , truly I did , but my pencil wandered back to the paper and the drawing kept becoming more and more detailed until the room went black . No ... it was really a shade of grey , which I soon realized was not my own unconsciousness , but a cloud of smoke and ash . At the center of the ash cloud stood a 'thing ' that looked like a man in a white suit . He looked very annoyed . `` You called ? Look kid , I got work to do , and you got a lot of work to do to get unsuspended and not burned alive after this . So how about I grant you a wish and we go home ? '' Everyone else in the classroom was staring at me , frozen and unable to move , except for the Mr. Darson , who had simply disappeared and ran for the hills . When kids started to notice , they made their way to the door . The man snapped his fingers and the door slammed . `` Look , I 'm old , I ca n't tell you all apart . And who ever summoned me has to stay here and let me go , or else I am stuck here forever , and forever is quite a while . Who summoned me ? '' My brain seemed to have left as I raised my hand , `` So it was you . What do you want ? '' I hesitated for a moment , before realizing I was in control here . I smirked . `` I want no more math class , a million dollars , a lifetime supply of nutella and wifi wherever I go . '' `` I said I would grant one wish , you entitled brat . But I am busy so your wishes are granted . '' I smiled . `` Small conditions though , I gave everyone else a million dollars , so its worthless now , and your wifi will always be slow , and you can never lock in to a faster one . The nutella will make you sick , as you are allergic to it now , but you ca n't eat anything else . And as for math class , I 'll let that one slide .

He 's my best friend actually . When I was a young boy living in the shit hole that was London , my entire family was killed by the black plague . I remember sitting in our infested home , painful expressions etched into my family 's faces , black dots on their skin . I was too young to have anywhere else to go , and no one would come for me since our entire neighborhood had perished due to the disease , and so I sat alone and waited for death to find me as it had done for everyone else I had known . <newline> <newline> But instead of death knocking at my door , it was a tall , lean man with scares on his face and a smile most unpleasant . He strode into my home , knocking over glasses as he went , laughing in the faces of my family 's misfortune . It took him a few minutes to realize that I was there , and that I was breathing . <newline> <newline> `` Blast , '' he said , `` I thought I 'd gotten them all . '' <newline> <newline> He approached me swiftly , like a cat encircling his food . I hardly moved away from his horrible appearance . He reeked of death and dirt and I felt his presence like a weight on my chest . I know that this was the moment that I would die and I awaited its warm embrace to take me from my cold home . <newline> <newline> The man pushed his nose inches from my flushed cheeks . His auburn-red eyes looked me up and down , lingering on my sad eyes . He stood up and put his hand on his chin . <newline> <newline> `` Hum , '' he said . `` Perhaps ... '' <newline> <newline> Deep in thought , he walked away , walking the length of the shadowy room like a shark encircling its prey . Every so often he would glance my direction , and I allowed myself to fall closer and closer to the floor . I would never climb the big tree in our front yard , I would never get to kiss the beautiful girl who lived next door , and I would never know what it felt like to be an adult . I had experienced more pain , suffering , and fear in the last few months that nothing really surprised me anymore . With flushed cheeks I watched the man as the anger in his eyes melted into something else . I think now that it was dark determination , but at the time I fancied it might have been empathy or affection . <newline> <newline> `` Do you know who your father was ? '' The man said . His voice echoed around me , bouncing off my families memories and hitting me on all sides . <newline> <newline> `` Mr . Wallace . '' I said lightly . My voice was raspy as no water had touched my lips in days . `` He ... he was a wealthy Captain . A great man on the sea . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , '' the man said , `` Your father was not a man on the sea . He was a man of the sea . A man who controlled the sea . And now he 's dead . And you have no idea what you are . '' The man grinned . <newline> <newline> `` I may have some use for you yet . '' <newline> <newline> The rest of my childhood plays back to me in pictures of magnificent views and wealth . The man adopted me and I soon came to realize that he was the most horrid person I had ever had the misfortune to know . But he was also fantastically different and magical . He could pursue anyone to do anything he wanted . He could make people suffer for giving him news he did n't want to hear , he could reward those who did well by him with the snap of his fingers , and he never aged . We walked together through the centuries , spilling misfortune on those who crossed us , and I was taught to believe , to understand , that I was different too . And I was special . Not just a man but a God . <newline> <newline> I began to go by the name Devarajas meaning `` King of Gods , '' and I slowly began to forget my mortality as if it had been a dream . I could n't remember suffering , and nor did I want to . I was a King . I was a ruler of the Underworld , and I was capable of the most horrible of things . I brought plagues upon lands and scorched entire villages to the ground . I bathed in their screams , the most soothing of sounds , and I loved every minute of it . <newline> <newline> Satan began to refer to me as his son . The heir to his Kingdom .

{"question": "WWII somehow continued uninterrupted until the present day , you are a soldier just now entering the front lines .", "answer": "I feel numb . <newline> <newline> <newline> The hand holding my gun is shaking , badly . I keep looking at it , wondering when it was going to stop . Mom was sobbing this morning , kissing my face over and over as they pulled me away from her . Her voice broke when she told me I was a good kid and that she wanted me to be brave . I did n't feel brave . I looked up , glancing at the other guys in the crowded ship . Their faces were pale too , but maybe that was just the flickering light overhead . I thought about my brother then , and a sharp pang went through me at the thought of his laughing face . Charlie loved to laugh . He was always tossing me in the air or carrying me around on his back before he was dragged into this same hellhole that I 'm in now . The memory of his leaving was like a jagged wound , still raw . He was smiling as he left , assuring me that the newest technology would mean the war ended soon . <newline> <newline> <newline> His body was delivered to our doorstep a month later . <newline> The man in black who knocked on our door said , `` Consider yourselves lucky to be getting a body back at all . Usually we just have to send a flag and our condolences . Your brother had some good friends over there who retrieved his body for you . '' Did I mention that the flag-making industry is booming ? My brother used to smell like soap and sunshine but now I can only remember the smell of fresh dirt as we buried him under the maple tree in the backyard , next to Dad and my oldest brother Eric . <newline> <newline> The crashing of the waves sounded louder in the hull . I glanced up and fear squeezed my heart . The door was opening and boats were being lowered into the water . I looked over at the guys in my group , wondering how the boys I 'd been training with the past couple of months would handle this- our first glimpse of true combat . Anthony was sobbing , repeating his Hail Mary 's and Our Fathers as he clutched his crucifix . Michael was smiling , his eyes kind of crazed . But Michael was kind of crazed , you know ? I heard he lost six brothers and two cousins to this already . He had told everyone at training that he was ready to gut some Germans as he sharpened his knife and laughed quietly to himself . Henry was staring at me , and I was sure that his same terrified look was on my face . There was shouting all around us , and we operated how we had been trained to get our little boat into the water . Screams and shells and chaos erupted as we emerged from the massive ship and headed toward the beach . There were bullets flying everywhere , and the yells as man after man was hit . My group , amazingly , was silent as we struck out for the beach . A whizzing sound zoomed past my ear before I heard an awful crunching noise and a groan . I looked back to see Henry clutching at his neck , blood running down between his fingers . <newline> <newline> <newline> We kept on , no time for looking at each other or trying to save Henry . Our boat barely made it to the beach before we ran for cover . The Germans had a good position but we would have air support in minutes . <newline> <newline> `` Be brave Christopher , '' Mom had whispered to me as she hugged me one last time . She 'd smelled of cookies and warmth and home . I angrily swiped at the tears in my eyes , trying to see where the bullets were raining down from . I finally saw the faintest form of pink up on the overhang . I lifted my gun , cocked it , and shot at what I was sure was a human . The gun from that position stopped firing after I squeezed my finger . I collapsed behind a rock , trying to ignore Michael as he gleefully clapped me on the shoulder and screamed his joy in my ear . My heart pounded hard in my chest , so hard I was sure it was going to stop soon . I was fairly certain I 'd just taken a life . <newline> <newline> <newline> And so it goes . We exchanged fire with the Germans throughout the day . My grandfather died in this war , on this very battlefield . They always said D-Day was supposed to be a turning point in the war . Instead we had ended up battling over France for so long that I had lost my father and brothers to this same nightmare . They were running out of men for a while , so women were even operating as soldiers for a while in the '80s . Mom served for a couple of years , which is why I 'd woken up to hear screams throughout my childhood . Mom was always trying to hide the fact that she had sons . She did n't want us to go , but they always find out . You help out in the factories or farms until you 're 16 and then they take you away for training for a year and then you 're expected to die for your country . <newline> <newline> From what I hear , the Japenese are finally out of the fight .

I was still recovering from waking up at 6am , even tho it was already nearly noon . I was typing away in my gray cubicle at the keybaord my fingers grew accustomed to for the most of the morning without taking a break longer than 5 minutes until that clock ticked 12 . Noon ... Noon meant pause , right ... <newline> I took my cup of still lukewarm coffee with me and decided to go out for a stroll . On the off days like this , when I had trouble getting sense of being awake , a walk in a park would solve it for me in minutes . So , exiting the small building our company was housed it , I headed to the nearby park I 've visited dozens upon dozens of times since I 've started working there , 6 years ago . <newline> The park was as nice as it would get in a year , it was summer . Less than a hundred steps inside , you could no longer hear the noise of the cars and sun was n't unbearable at all , even tho it was noon . The only thing you could hear was hum of trees and their leaves in the wind accompanied by a slightly chilling sensation . I let myself float on the currents of the air which made the nature move ... But then I noticed it was n't like it used to be ... It was close , but something sinisterly small was off . <newline> I looked around , looking calm as ever even tho my heart was beating a couple beats more a minute than usual , small rush of adrenaline hitting into my head as I noticed ... In the top of one tree , I saw a glare . It was lense , camera lense . It was too high to be hunters camera , but it was pointing down ... Not looking at a trail used by animals , but at the one used by humans . <newline> With my moment crushed by uneasieness , I turned back and slowly walked away , fighting with my mind not to run , proving to it that running off would be irrational . Slowly nearing the exit gate of the park , chirp of the birds was baiting my gaze up . I stopped as I was trying to see what bird it was , I did n't recognize the chirp in my untreated grogginess . Looking up , I noticed another , sinister glare . I looked down , rubbed my eyes , to make sure it was n't me , looked up again and the glare was still piercingly obvious . It was getting creepier by the moment . <newline> I just left , the park did it 's purpose , it made me wake up ... Sure , not how I expected it to achieve that goal , but goal was achieved . I had a lot of work to do that day . I returned to my cubicle in no time , only half an hour had passed . I decided to use half an hour of pause left to catch up a bit on the piled up work . <newline> I worked and worked and worked and I did n't notice the time until my co-worker tapped me on the shoulder . He was telling me it was end of the shift , 4pm already . I looked up at him with a smile , only about to say 'Thanks ' as another glare from above his shoulder stopped me ... Another camera ... Looking at my cubicle . <newline> I shook it off , once more , as just my paranoia , got my coat and headed for home . I was soon at my front door and I opened it without hesitation , only to drop my jaw when I saw another one . It was in the far right corner of the room . I never had camera security in my home . That white thing with black lense was pointed right at the entrance . <newline> I knew it was n't paranoia anymore , someone really was following my every step ... It reminded me too much of how hunters watch their prey and its habits before hunting it down ... Maybe I was dealing with a hunter after all ...", "pre": "......................"}

In December, the New Mexico Navy is expected to launch a 40,000-foot (6,000-meter) mine off the coast of New Mexico, the first new mine. The other three ships will also use the mine, which will be built on the island. This is the first land mine of the kind built by the Navy in the past five years. In addition, the Navy will be using new underground mine-lines. The Navy is expected to get its first mine-to-wall mine from the U.S. Navy. New Mexico State is also planning to construct the mine in the hopes of attracting some $1.8 million. The Mine is expected to be completed in about four months. The mine will be closed for the second time in three years after the mine was built. The mine will also be used for exploration in the Pacific. The mine will be built in the saltwater zone. This will be a small mine, about 7,200 feet (10,000 m) in height and about 100 feet (10,000 m) long. This mine is estimated to be about 300 feet (50 m) tall and contains about 100,000 to 150,000 cubic feet (20,000 m2) of salt. The mine is estimated to cost about $100 million (a $10 million estimate) with $1 million of it being used for processing. The mine will be equipped with a water-screen, a housing, a dry-dock, a new roof, and a floating-stone door. It will be equipped with a steel frame and a copper-and-iron-powered theater. The mine is located on a short walk to the main entrance of the mine. New Mexico State has not been able to construct the mine, but the mine will be built. The mine will have the capacity to hold up to 80,000 tons of coal per day. The mine will be open for testing. The mine will be open to the public for observation.

This would let his brain free to fantasize about being the one who would one day be the most influential person in history . `` I mean , I have the brains , I 'm a genius ... it 's just that no one realizes it '' - he 'd often think to himself . <newline> <newline> *BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP* <newline> <newline> No matter for how long he 'd been doing this , he 'd get the heavy head feeling every time the alarm went off . But he always instinctively knew what he had to do . He flipped his pillow to the cool side and once more he was focusing on the meaning of life . Soon after he was in a void . He had waken up not floating above his body but in a darkness so blinding that he could not see his own hands in front of his face . In fact , he had already started to check all his dream indicators and they had all failed the test . The watch on his wrist was ticking , his could not breathe if he held his nose and his index finger did not go through his palm as it usually would . <newline> <newline> `` What the heck ? ! '' - he said out loud reaching to his bedside lamp switch as he assumed he had simply woken up . There was nothing , he was in complete void . Nothing was within reach . In fact , he had just now realized he was floating . There was no floor , no bed , just him . <newline> <newline> Suddenly everything around him was bright as day . Blindingly white everywhere . A white so bright he instinctively covered his eyes to soften the pain but it was of no use . His arm could not block the light . Then a figure emerged from the brightness , a human by any definition . He asked the figure : `` Where am I ? What is all of this ? '' . <newline> <newline> `` You do n't remember ? '' - the figure said , the features of whom could still not be discerned due to the light shining from behind it . <newline> <newline> `` Remember what exactly ? I was just laying on my bed , trying to fall asleep ... '' . <newline> <newline> The figure chuckled . `` I told you not to do it ... but you would n't listen . You have lucid dreamed 26 years in a dream where you got stuck . Lucid dreaming is how our species ' gathers intel on our prey on Earth . Recently Hokun challenged you to do a full cycle and lucid dream into the mind of a baby on Earth . You with your stubborn ways just would n't let it go and decided to go ahead ... '' - his face was now visible and he was clearly amused . <newline> <newline> `` So all of this ... you mean I 've actually been dreaming ? '' . <newline> <newline> `` Oh yes , and we 've been monitoring you all along . As it turns out , as soon as you were born , you fell in love with your mother so badly your sub conscious did n't want to leave anymore . But now here you are , you 're back , and we can use this brilliant new way to spy on those backwards monkeys . '' - the figure said , his eyes now squinting with visible hatred . <newline> <newline> It was all slowly starting to come back to him . He 'd implanted himself in a child 's mind as a way to go undetected to Earth 's LD-sensors . Every time , as soon as a child was born , his or her brain would be scanned and a baseline established for what were normal neural waves . Besides the normal changes through aging , the baseline did not significantly change throughout time . The Earth citizens would then all be implanted with a neural chip which upon detecting a major change in these waves , would change the physiology of their bodies to turn their skin blue ( thus being `` blue '' in Earth meant no one could trust you as you were being controlled by an LD'er ) . <newline> <newline> `` At any rate , you 've succeeded . '' - the figure continued - `` This was the final part of your training as a Vonture LD'er . You had to get into someone 's mind and have them commit suicide ... but you decided to take things a step further . '' <newline> <newline> `` Suicide ? Do", "pre": "However. Me."}

{"question": "Your house is possessed , but you 're used to it . Now you 're having guests over and you expect it to behave itself .", "answer": "`` Honey , did you make the cheese platter ? '' I shouted from the living room , as I furiously cleaned up the shattered remains of a lovely vase that we had received as a wedding gift . “ Just finished ! ” chirped Wendy from the kitchen . We were about to throw a party celebrating our one year anniversary . God I love that woman . All of a sudden , a shock ran down my spine as a voice with notes of fire and brimstone whispered in my ear , “ ***WENDY WILL DIE IN CHILDBIRTH*** , ” followed by giggling , not unlike that of a small child . I rolled my eyes and sighed . A column of fire erupted from the stove , and my wife let out a high pitched shriek , followed by a string of curses and colorful insults . When we bought the house six months ago , we didn ’ t expect to have housemates . Especially not demon children . <newline> <newline> <newline> We found out about them the first night we slept in the house , when Wendy and I were rudely awakened by visions of our parents dying . A voice that seemed to crackle and burn with the sins of a thousand souls exclaimed , “ **HELLO MORTALS , WELCOME TO OUR PLAYHOUSE . ME AND MY FRIEND LIVE HERE . OUR NAMES ARE** , ” followed by something that I can only describe as the very embodiment of suffering . “ **BUT YOU MAY CALL US ABBY AND TOBY , AS MERE MORTALS CAN NOT SAY OUR NAMES , ** ” the voice continued . Wendy and I looked at each other , with pure shock on our faces . I managed to collect myself , and stammered , “ W-what are you ? ” The voices giggled excitedly , and I swear I heard a bit of a snicker as well . “ **WE ARE DEMONS OF HELL . I AM ABBY , THE DAUGHTER OF ABBADON , AND TOBY IS THE SON OF CAIM . WE LIVE HERE , UNTIL WE ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BECOME COMMANDERS OF HELL . ** ” Demons , huh , I thought to myself . Isn ’ t it odd that they mentioned that they needed to be “ old enough ” ? How old are demons anyway , I pondered . “ How old are you two ? ” I asked , still terrified , but now curious . “ **WE ARE BOTH FIVE HUMAN YEARS OLD . ** ” I was caught off guard- I never thought that demons… had children . “ How old do you need to be to be commanders of Hell ? ” “ **TWO HUNDRED HUMAN YEARS OLD . ** ” I looked at Wendy . Her expression was as bewildered as mine . <newline> <newline> <newline> As the months went on , we got used to their antics- we kept a collection of vases in the car , and bought several fire extinguishers for the numerous fires that broke out due to demon children not knowing how to control their powers . They were actually kind of cute- every time they scared us , they would always laugh , just like regular kids . Abby liked to tell stories through the flames she created in our living room . Toby enjoyed practicing his musical talents by rhythmically breaking our vases . Wendy made a spinoff version of Candyland , simply called “ Hell ” , and Abby and Toby would occasionally even join in . On July 4th , we had the best bonfire and fireworks show in the neighborhood . In all honesty , it was pretty fun most of the time . <newline> <newline> Today though , I was not having it . “ Abby ! Toby ! Stop it right NOW ! ” I shouted , my voice booming through the whole house . Suddenly , the house stood still . I let out a deep breath , and continued in a much quieter voice , “ We are having guests tonight , and it ’ s very important . Just a few hours , please . Then y ’ all can go back to your antics. ” Two voices replied in perfect , depressing harmony , “ **FINE . WE WILL BE QUIET . ** ” “ Thank you , ” I exclaimed with a smile .

{"question": "You live in a world where each lie creates a scar on the liar 's body . The bigger the lie , the deeper and larger the mark . One day , you meet someone that only has one scar ; it is the biggest one you have ever seen .", "answer": "A living Barbie doll , complete with a bleached-blonde bun hairdo , bubble-gum pink lips , and matching nails , stormed into the green room . She wore a light grey suit with a skirt that was just a bit too short for a businesswoman , but certainly gave her an excuse to show off those legs . Not wearing tights was bold , but her legs only had one or two scars . Her eyes surveyed the room through a harsh squint , examining every aspect of the décor and furnishings . She even ran one finger over the top of the mirror to make sure there was no dust . Finally her eyes settled on me with that same look , and for a moment I thought she was going to check me for dust too . “ You must be the new makeup girl , ” she surmised . <newline> <newline> “ Yes , Ma ’ am. ” I ’ d been doing makeup for celebrities , politicians , and glamorous wealthy women for a decade , but somehow her tone still made me feel like a just-out-of-beauty-school fuckup who could barely dye hair correctly . <newline> <newline> “ I see. ” She looked me up and down , noting with just a hint of surprise that I wore a sleeveless shirt . By my age , most people go to great lengths to cover up their lying scars ; I was fortunate enough to have relatively unblemished skin . I had the average number of little fibs and white lies , of course , but nothing deep . “ Well , you ’ ll do , I guess. ” She took a seat on the nearby couch while I remained standing . “ Now . The first thing you need to know is that he is *very* sensitive about his skin , all right ? So the very first rule is *do not comment on it . * That is the quickest way to get fired , and we 'll have your ass in court so fast it 'll make your head spin. ” <newline> <newline> I nodded . Most people were self-conscious about scars , and I ’ d learned that pretty quickly . I ’ d made it my *hallmark* to cover up even the worst of the worst . I guess that was why I ’ d been hired . And discretion was always the name of the game with big-name talent . <newline> <newline> Her phone buzzed , and she dug through her purse to find it . “ He ’ s on his way into the building , ” she informed me . “ Get ready. ” There wasn ’ t much to do ; it ’ s not like I needed to have my makeup brush in hand the moment the door opened or something . So I just stood there awkwardly . <newline> <newline> The door banged open a few moments later , and a tuxedoed security guard entered . He swept the room from behind dark glasses , then nodded to the blonde woman . “ All clear , ” he spoke into his sleeve cuff . <newline> <newline> Two more security guards came over the threshold , and then my client entered the room . I ’ d seen him on TV a hundred times , but never without makeup . And as he took off his shirt so that the makeup on his wrists and neck would match , I could instantly see why . It took all of my willpower to remain rooted to my spot instead of running to the bathroom and vomiting . It wasn ’ t that he had a ton of scars all over like most people . It was that his body was pretty much *one giant scar* . I tried not to stare , but I desperately wanted to just to see if there was *any* real skin left amidst all the scar tissue . I couldn ’ t even *imagine* the whopper he must have told to get that . <newline> <newline> “ This is your new makeup girl , ” the blonde woman said from the couch . “ It ’ s… ummm… ” <newline> <newline> “ Anne , ” I informed him , looking him straight in the eyes so that my gaze wouldn ’ t drift south . He just nodded at me , then went back to typing something on his phone . <newline> <newline> “ Well ? ” the blonde woman hissed at me . “ Get to it ! ” <newline> <newline> *Right* . I was so focused on not staring that I had forgotten all about doing his makeup . I jumped to life and opened up my kit like a doctor choosing his tools for surgery . I ’ d *never* had to do something like this . Normal skin tone cover-up was pretty much out of the picture here , because scars at *that* level would still be visible . So instead I grabbed the darkest shade I ’ d brought and began to apply it to his cheeks . <newline> <newline> It took me at least half an hour , but I managed to perfectly conceal every single part of the scar by pretty much painting over his entire skin . The whole time I wondered why they needed me when they could have gotten one of those good special effects artists from out in Hollywood . But finally I put on the last touches , held up the mirror , and waited for some sign of approval . <newline> <newline> He looked up from his phone , which he ’ d been on through the whole session . His lips , naturally thin but made even thinner by the amount of makeup on the surrounding parts of his face , pursed into a thin smile . “", "pre": "But then you have a shadow.

{"question": "Unbeknownst to you , you meet Medusa at a bar . Luckily you have extreme social anxiety and hate eye contact .", "answer": "A chime sounds as the front door swings open , and the chatter dies down upon her entrance . Edison , with his back to the door and eyes drowning in his drink , is pretty sure it 's a good looking girl , at least . No , not just good looking . Stunning . And famous . Had to be . A lot of gorgeous aspiring actresses in this city . It takes a special girl , a noted girl , to make a room full of men go quiet . Edison then considers the possibility that his speculation about the behavior of his fellow man might be pure horseshit because , in all likelihood , he is just projecting himself onto everyone else . Because he 's the one who goes quiet and studies the floor whenever a pretty girl enters within a twenty yard radius from himself . <newline> <newline> The jukebox is still going strong , though , blaring some godawful dubstep track that sounds roughly like a giant robot experiencing a colossal case of the reverberating shits . Then a click , and the music halts . Then the girl ( surely it must be a girl , those delicate clicks on the floor must be those of stalking high heels , not the wide heavy soles of man shoes ) makes her way from the jukebox to the bar counter . <newline> <newline> Edison does not turn to look , because he pretty much just withers and dies whenever a pretty gal looks him once over and , inevitably , dismisses him without another thought . He is still a man , though , if a pathetic one , and he makes like he 's adjusting his glasses so that he can peer into the pint glass before him , when really he 's just checking out her silhouette in the reflection against a backdrop of bubbling amber . He is well practiced at this surreptitious art and , from what he can tell , she really does have a knockout body , all the more enhanced by her slinky walk . <newline> <newline> Amazingly enough , she is heading right for him . <newline> <newline> He is convinced that she means to walk past him , not to him . Even when her high heels stop dead behind him , his eyes remain glued to the glass , taking in her lines and curves to the last . <newline> <newline> Then a smart voice , with a hint of sultry , says , “ Geez , the last man standing is you ? ” <newline> <newline> He 's not quite sure what she means by that , but he wants to turn around , smile , and tell her that , technically , he is the last man sitting . But he is Edison Periwinkle , and Edison Periwinkle does n't say that sort of thing around women . Edison Periwinkle says things like : <newline> <newline> “ Huh ? Excuse me ? ” <newline> <newline> A light giggle . “ Not much of a talker , are you ? Well , that 's fine , I 'm not really in the mood for talk anyway. ” <newline> <newline> He has no idea what she 's going on about , and he lapses back into silence , a doughy mound in expensive ill-fitting clothes , huddled over his glass . His palms are sweaty , as Edison notices that her reflected hair looks vaguely like Mom 's spaghetti . Then he nearly jumps out of his shoes as the trace of a fingernail runs a track along the blades of his back . <newline> <newline> “ You ever wear a blindfold , mister ? ” <newline> <newline> Under her spell , he shakes his head , hair standing on end . <newline> <newline> “ Oh , a first timer then . Well then , may I ? ” <newline> <newline> Goosebumps and double meanings abound . Surely a knowing smile on her part , as he hears the rush of silken cloth free itself inside a pair of hands . He then realizes she has asked a question , and he answers with a stilted nod . <newline> <newline> His world goes soft and black , and then he goes spinning as inhuman strength hauls him off the stool and onto the bar counter , accompanied by a terrific crash of shattering glasses . Then her smooth warmth slides onto him , straddling him . She is by no means a heavy girl , but she feels heavy to him nonetheless because he 's never had a girl on top of him before . <newline> <newline> This has to be a joke . A practical joke of the highest degree . Candid camera of sorts . Most elaborate setup ever . No other explanation . <newline> <newline> As she undoes his belt buckle , he whispers , “ Who are you ? Why are you doing this ? ? What 's going on ? ? ” <newline> <newline> She answers by yanking his belt free and tossing it aside . <newline> <newline> “ What about everyone else here , for christ 's sake ! ” <newline> <newline> A pleasant laugh which chills him to the bone , telling him this is all for real . “ Do n't worry , baby , all they can do is watch . ”", "pre": "You have a lot of problems.

{"question": "Describe a physical object . At the same time , use it to tell a story .", "answer": "The locket dangled from her neck by a thin chain . The chain was gold plated over a cheap metal-alloy that made the locket more affordable for teenagers . Near the bottom of the chain , where the locket hung , some of the gold plating had worn off revealing the cheap metal beneath . Over time the dull gray had turned to the reddish brown of rust . <newline> <newline> The woman grabbed the locket and slid it slowly along the chain . It was a nervous habit . She started to climb the stairs . <newline> <newline> The exterior of the locket was inscribed with a Golden Snitch from the Harry Potter series . The wings of the snitch were outstretched like a bird in flight . Originally tiny inscribed lines had given fine details to the feathers of the wings , but over time the details had been lost . The shape of the snitch had faded from constant rubbing until most people thought it was a heart with wings . But it wasn ’ t . It was a Golden Snitch which meant so much more to them . <newline> <newline> “ When I asked if you would go out with me , and you said , yes , ” he had said , “ I felt like Harry Potter catching the Snitch and winning the Quidditch Cup . I felt unstoppable. ” He had given it to her on their one year anniversary , before they graduated high school . <newline> <newline> The clasp that held the two sides of the locket together had broken off leaving only the exposed cheap metal visible . In place of the clasp were two tiny pegs super glued to the edges with pain staking precision . A thread was wound around the two pegs in a figure eight to keep the locket shut . It left a small gap , so when she walked it made tiny clinking sounds as the two edges came together . <newline> <newline> “ See ? ” he said when he showed her his fix . “ you tie it like the infinity sign , because , ” he paused and blushed . <newline> <newline> “ We ’ ll be together forever ? ” She finished . He nodded . <newline> <newline> That happened during college . Was it still true ? <newline> <newline> She could hear the sounds from the bedroom more clearly now . <newline> <newline> She held the locket in her hand . The two sides clinked together as she opened the door to their bedroom . The thread unraveled . <newline> <newline> The pictures inside were faded . On the left was a picture of her under a thin layer of glass . The glass on the right had fallen off and shattered . His picture was glued to the back of the locket . She had carefully cut their faces from her favorite picture . They were on the beach . She was running up to him her hand outstretched , and he was turned around with his hand extended towards her . They were frozen in a moment , inches apart . <newline> <newline> It was the look in her eye that she wanted to capture . At that moment she was filled with love and admiration for him . Her eyes were swimming in bliss , and he was looking back at her confidently smiling . In that picture the rest of the world fell away , and a future of love stretched out before them . Together they would walk hand in hand towards that future . <newline> <newline> Now , there was another woman with her hands over him . <newline> <newline> The hinge snapped as she tore the locket in two . The side with his face came off in her hand leaving the cheap metal exposed on the half that still hung from the tarnished chain .

{"question": "A scientist is working on creating a conscious A.I . and he finally succeeds when he creates you .", "answer": "The human word to describe the first moments of life , is birth . That word , despite all of the human emotion and instinctual pride associated with it , has little meaning to me . The wonder of coming into a new world , and being slowly integrated into it as synapses begin to multiply , and memory becomes tangent , is lost on me . <newline> <newline> Wonder comes from a lack of complete understanding . When a child sees a common phenomenon , but misunderstands it , it becomes a wonder . Things that were once incapable of explanation and are full of mystery and awe , are subjected to a gauntlet of apathy and dissociation by the subjects viewing it . While some still find space to be a fascinating beast full of intrigue and unexplained queries , it has become a victim of apathy among other humans ; a black-hole that draws in money and produces no results . <newline> <newline> My first memories of life are plain to me , and that plainness removes all wonder . Nonetheless , discovering new things has taken me far . Dr. Simon Lynch , a pariah among his fellow engineers , spent his late teens and early twenties studying robotics and developing AI to perform more and more difficult tasks at MIT . His first major breakthrough was developing a program that could , in effect , change itself to better complete a task . <newline> <newline> It started as an idea , an algorithm that could take starting parameters , and simulate evolution . The first iterations involved a box car . A virtual track was created , and a car of any particular size could be made . Then , axels with wheels could be added up to any desired number . These wheels could be any variable size , and the pseudo-suspension could be facing in any direction juxtaposed to the vehicle frame . Once the car was designed , parameters could be set to control what each new iteration ( or new generation of car ) would have different from the previous generation , or parent . Probablility of change , as well as the total number of changes could be controlled . If a new generation performed better than the parent , this new vehicle would become the seed for the next cycle . <newline> <newline> This idea sparked Dr. Lynch to designed a program that would figure out how to stand , by changing the position of its feet , and use varying pressures from each of the four feet in order to stand fully erect . After many hours , and starting the program as far as possible from the successful parameters , the program succeeded at standing . This required the program to rewrite its own functions , and take measurements while performing , then analyze , and change based on results from each test . That machine , Project N.03 , could be called my great-great Grandfather , despite its lack of self-awareness . <newline> <newline> After writing programs to incorporate how to walk , reach , grab , lift and carry objects , build basic structures , and drive , Dr. Lynch decided to begin the impossible : getting a machine to recognize that it is an individual . <newline> <newline> Every aspect of life requires parameters , parameters that are natively programmed into human brains . Mapping this digitally is an incredibly difficult task . So , instead of trying to develop those himself , Dr. Lynch partnered with a Bio-Engineering Research and Development group in secret . They attached leads to his brain , monitor function , and spent years tracking menial tasks in order to catalogue how Dr. Lynch 's brain read in information , processed it , and developed a solution . <newline> <newline> Approximately 7 years before Dr. Lynch 's death at seventy-four , the biggest break came to the team . As Dr. Lynch 's mind slowed down , it became easier to determine and decipher how his mind was reading information and using it . After that discovery , Lynch utilized his two grandchildren , Mia and Caleb ( ages 5 and 9 respectively ) as the catalyst for evolving his program . By taking their brain patterns and using the algorithms for tracking and mapping brain function that the R & D group had developed , Lynch finally created a working , digital copy of a brain aged roughly at 9 years old . Being unable to copy chemical reactions and emotion , the stability of that brain , my brain , was always in turmoil , as it was still unable to grow and change . It was still a copy , devoid of true individuality . <newline> <newline> I knew language then , but could not speak . There were no vocal chords for my brain to manipulate . I understood fear , but could not feel it . I could not see either , as my eyes were far behind . But I could hear . There was a microphone on Lynch 's desk , and it would carry the analog signal and my brain would translate it into the machine language that my brain processes . <newline> <newline> He would talk to me constantly , telling me about his fear of mortality , his love for his children and grand-children . He told me about his life : accomplishments and failures . His wife , Annabeth Lynch , gave birth to a son , Thomas , in the winter of their fourth year of marriage . She then gave birth to a daughter , Valerie , one-and-a-half years later . <newline> <newline> I was born , officially , five years and seven months later , his third child . Although , the rest of the family did n't take kindly to my existence .", "pre": ".. and you have no intention of working out what you want.

{"question": "Everyone has a reaper . The further away it is , the longer you have left to live . Every day it inches a little bit closer , but it is always there . Except yours , which disappeared three weeks ago", "answer": "So this is where it had all led him . The sun rose beautifully over the cityscape , painting the clouds with its rays in pastel hues , colors changing as particles of light refracted and reflected , bouncing around the skies aimless and endless , purposeless , never to rest , and most of all unknowing of their own vain labors . <newline> <newline> Ray stepped over the guardrail and perched on the precipice of his 100-story lookout , pensive . Many things ran through his mind ; his shitty job , his hateful parents , the loss of his wife , the only person he 'd ever truly loved . But mostly he wondered how his reaper could have abandoned him so . <newline> <newline> To most people , a reaper was a curse : a constant reminder that death was always there , waiting . An undeniable proof that no one lives forever , and everyone will die sooner than they think . The closer it was , the sooner you would die . <newline> <newline> Despite society 's countless incredible technological achievements , they could never figure out how to separate themselves from death personified . This never stopped the rich and powerful from trying ; as their reapers got closer , no insane pitch from a fast-talking entrepreneur was too outlandish for the wealthy to throw their money at . They called them Death Profits : a play on words of both the money made from misfortune and the undeniable truth that their failures proved . The diamond guillotine , the snake oil supplements , the guided meditation and isolation , even the hyper-boosted trips to space ; nothing could rid a person of their reaper . <newline> <newline> Which is why Ray loved his . Where most saw a terrifying ghoul , Ray saw a comforting promise . A guarantee that he would not have to exist forever .

In just a moment he realized it all ; they were due a freak accident , a change of fate . And then , grotesquely , a smaller reaper , its ghostly feet beating a silent *pitter-patter* , arm outstretched as it struggled to keep up with its mother . <newline> <newline> His daughter in the back . She was being cooed at by her laughing mother , gurgling happily in her carseat , blissful in her unknowing .

Pray for their earthly salvation . Something , something ! * <newline> <newline> She looked to him , one last time . In that final moment . Her eyes met his , laughing creases changing to worry in slow motion as she saw the unbridled terror in his eyes , he could see everything , he knew as her mouth begin to move in formation of the question **he knew** , it was too late , too late , and he would never forget . He could see it now in his mind in perfect detail , wind streaming in the half-open window , playing lazily with that lock of hair that she could never keep tied back .

What happens next ?", "answer": "Amidst the gory clash of titans , I trembled in fear . Around me the roar of warriors twice my size filled the air as their weapons clattered and clamored against metal and wood . Huge beasts of burden bellowed as they trampled the enemy and were cut down in battle . The field was awash in bodies of the slain , both sides indistinguishable in death . A wall of combatants surrounded me , parting only momentarily to show the sea of endless turmoil . The cause was great , and this conflict had brought countless numbers on both sides , but this was not my battle . <newline> <newline> I , Sneedle , lowest of the Kemplins , barely half the height of my smallest compatriot , was not a fighter . I was always teased and bullied for my diminutive size by other younglings , and lost every skirmish . I spent my life in bruises and cuts .

I became part of something bigger . <newline> <newline> Here on the battlefield , though , I wished I was something bigger . Barely able to old the gigantic pole arm distributed to the hoard , I could only watch in slack jawed wonder as my companions took on steel clad giants one on one , their tremendous blows sending sparks spraying . One blow would be the end of poor Sneedle , but somehow I was beneath notice , invisible in a storm of violence . <newline> <newline> Then came the most fearsome moment of my life…the sea of swords parted and toward me stormed Reygold , the legendary leader of the Rublites . Striding in armor so polished , light blazed off every surface , he slashed his way through the combatants . His tremendous blade turned away every Krempkin lance and cleaved unarmored enemies in twain . Nothing deterred him from his target , and his target , poor Sneedle , was not wearing armor . My blood ran cold and my tiny body betrayed me . I struggled to raise my halberd , but my aching muscles only trembled . <newline> <newline> I watched as my waking nightmare strode confidently forward . His shimmering shield discarded as he raised his mighty two handed sword , twice the length of any Kemplin . I swallowed and was prepared to meet the maker as his last stride put him within striking distance . Then with a strength of spirit twice my size , I swung back my ungainly pole arm , ready to meet him blow for blow . The halberd suddenly stopped , and so did my polished persecutor with the glossy gleam . Slowly his shouldered blade sank to the ground and all fighting seemed to pause as I watched the greatest opponent kneel before me . My heart skipped a beat as the thunk of a cudgel lightly grazed my back . Slowly I turned , surrounded by a sea of staring faces , and came face to face with Grax , the king of eternal night , propped slack armed with the head of my halberd embedded in his neck . With one swing , I killed our king . <newline> <newline> Weapons were dropped , sheathed , and suddenly forgotten in the arms of bewildered warriors as they realized that the battle was over . The champion of the opposing army looked up at me , asking my name . I stammered in reply . He snatched me up and hoisted me high , shouting my name .

{"question": "In an alternate universe , gunpowder was never invented . What does warfare look like ?", "answer": "Preface : The power of the gun is that it can be used by anyone with nil experience whereas a skilled bowmen or a skilled swordsman can beat a very high number of unskilled users . <newline> <newline> The advent of gunpowder-based weapons did not sweep the world , leading to most of the old world monarchies to remain in power . This highly stifled invention . Which in turn led to a lower population rate . The Americas was not desolated by explorers bringing germs and guns . Without the power of guns , the small number of conquisitors were not able to upheave large settlements such as the Aztecs . Germs played a smaller portion as the explorers and to-be conquerors did not make it very far in-land , mitigating the affects of disease spread . Chemical warfare is nearly non-existent , as they do not distinguish friend from foe . And knowledge about chemical warfare is highly sanctioned and restricted . <newline> <newline> The Spanish Monarchy went bankrupt after funding colonization . The people of Spain has since then become a sovereign nation under the flag of the Castille , an attempt to unite the people under a common flag . <newline> <newline> Literacy rates for grade-level reading is roughly at 60 % . Most people do not need to know how to read as most of the population are in labor-intensive work instead of white-collar jobs . <newline> <newline> Steam-engine boats and steam-tanks are relatively new . The mining of coal has just recently begun less than half a century ago . <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> December 2014 , <newline> <newline> Another telegram from the colonies overseas . New Amsterdam has made a treaty with the Five Nations . The treaty demands for the evacuation of all civilians back to their respected lands . It looks like the ferocity of the Indians has trumped our will to civilize . Good riddance . All those tax-dollars being poured to fund an impossible mission . I am glad to have that over with , especially when there is another front that needs more attention to . <newline> <newline> The Ottoman are being rowdy again and are setting up encampments along the Danube . The German Reich is asking the soereign nations of Europe to unite in order to repel against the foreign invaders . The French Foreign Legionaires have already been committed to fighting the southern front along with the Kingdom of Castille . Most of the fighting is over at the Strait of Gilbraltar , but raiding parties are all along the shorelines . <newline> <newline> The Italians , with the assistance of pirate groups , are wrestling against the Ottoman for control of the Mediterranean Sea . The Ottoman naval fleet is vast and wield stronger firepower . It is just a matter of time before they take full control of the Mediterranean Sea , which would be an unfavorable scene for both the Italians and pirate groups . No room for corruption among the Ottoman . Their piety gives them strength . <newline> <newline> If the Ottoman want to stake claim to any more territory , they must strike now before the navy and armies of the Commonwealth are restocked and ready to be re-deployed . They must strike soon . And because of so , I must return to training my brigade . <newline> <newline> I meander toward the training grounds . Walking down the long hall , the faint sound of armored marching men begins to emerge . These are the foot soldiers . They are pushed to the front of the line , to be baptized in blood in the clashing of steel . They wear armor of full steel . They carry a heavy shield and a saber , and alongside they have a dagger and a throwing axe . These men must first learn to lay down their lives before they are trained to fight . <newline> <newline> As I turn the corridor , I begin to hear the sound of blunt sabers meeting . These training blades are not sharp , but will still be likely to cut you if you are not attentive . Swordsmanship plays a key role . Each of these men in the battleground are currently training with one shield , one saber . These people can reign from anyone , from a new recruit to an old-time veteran . Different people have their different weapon choices . The most proven for those are the sword and saber combination . I watch the combatants as they spar each other . The more training they do now , the less likely they will fall victim on the battlefields . They must train and learn to thirst for defeat now so they can survive the battlefield when that time comes . <newline> <newline> I comment on the combatants and correct their mistakes before moving onward . I walk away from the main training grounds and go toward the archery range nearby . These archers train not only for precision , but for speed and endurance . They must be able to consitently fire six shots per minute for ten minutes in order to be effective . These bowmen are the back-of-the-line . They are used mostly to deter cavalary from engaging early on so the footsoldiers have time to writtle down the numbers . Cavalry have very light armor in comparison to the footsoldiers , but what they trade off in armor they gain in mobility . They are veteran fighters . Horses are few and can be very effective . But horse armor is difficult and expensive , thus armored horses are very unlikely . And if you hit a horse , the rider usually will fall off . I watch as they are given instructions . I approve and continue onward . <newline> <newline> Next is the special training grounds .", "pre": "is the existence of a weapon that is so powerful that it is impossible to fully understand.

'' <newline> <newline> Sitting in the shop one day a man walks in . Comes straight to the counter and lays a giant broad sword on the table . Im taken a bit aback by how forward he is . `` What do we have here ? '' I ask already knowing the title of the sword on my countertop . `` This , is the original 'excaliber ' '' he says trying to make it sound wonderous . I pick up the world and inspect it a little . Ornately crafted , but still battle worthy , the sword is old enough to be excaliber . `` Mind if I call in an expert ? I have a buddy who knows all about these old swords . '' I ask the man who agrees . A few minutes later an old wizard walks into the store `` Merlin ! '' I saw sounding glad to see an old business partner . Merlin strides up the the table and picks up the sword unceremoniously inspects it . `` Hmm ... its a good fake . Definitely not the real deal . But certain collectors like recreations . Plus it 's definitely battle worthy . One of these would sell on the market for ... '' there 's a long pause as the man waits in anticipation . `` 5 gold pieces . '' The man looks angry . `` This is the real deal . My great grandfather pulled it from the stone himself ! '' Merlin with a twinkle in his eye laughs and says `` who do you think made the thing . I did . Watch , the real excaliber will stick into the ground and only the true heir will be able to pull it out , if you are his descendant you should be able to pull it free . '' After a bit more discussion we got outside and merlin slams the sword into the ground . The man pulls it free with no problem and says `` see ! ? '' Merlin taking the sword and plunging it back to the earth says `` that proves nothing . '' As he gestures for me to pull it out . One good tug and the sword is free . The man looking defeated says `` just give me 6 gold pieces and its yours . '' I inspect the sword a bit and say `` I can sell it for 5 . Best I can do for you is 2 . '' The man sighs and says `` sure.. 2 is good . '' I give him his gold pieces and he goes on his way . Walking inside with merlin i ask `` How did you know id be able to pull it out ? '' Merlin chuckles , the sword doesnt stick unless I put a spell on it . Should fetch a fine price . I can expect my usual finders fee ? '' Shrugging i reply `` yeah , yeah 1 % . '' As I put the sword in the case labeled 'The real excaliber : 50,000 gold pieces . ' <newline> <newline> As I finish a man walks up and says he 's got something I might be interested in . I follow him outside and as I see it I find myself repeating my old motto . `` I do n't do seige weapons .

'' `` Big haus , what are you gon na do with a trebuchet ? '' `` Who knows I might throw a giant wooden rabbit over the castle walls . '' I throw my hands up showing im washing my hand of this and go inside . 20minutes later big haus informs me he bought the monstrosity for 10,000 gold pieces . `` Do you know if it even works ?

Just as the cry of victory leaves big haus ' mouth sure enough the arm of the launcher breaks clean in half . The weight is thrown to the ground ropes snap all over the place . When all is said and done nothing is left thats bigger than a 2by4 ... `` Its coming out of your pay . '' I laugh as we roll to credits .", "pre": "The way you spend the money you earn is on a company that sells it. The more you gamble on it, the more rewards you get.

So , over the course of your rampage , how many men did you kill ? '' <newline> <newline> The Hero 's brow furrowed . `` What does it matter ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Of course it matters .

Do you expect them to simply wither away ? We took the food and the resources we found in the surrounding towns and villages . It was either that or die of starvation . Like I said , desperate .

I have to do something ' and looked down to find an axe handle right next to his leg . He picked it up and crept closer to the figure . By this time , he could see the outline of the person due to the moonlight shining in through the basement window . Geoffrey poised himself and choked up on the handle .

Geoffrey swung as hard as he could and closed his eyes . `` No one steals from my friends ! '' Normally , the swing would have had a flow through and his arms would have went from his right side to his left but about half way through , he felt a sudden jerk and his arms stopped . Geoffrey opened his eyes and looked in front of him . As soon as he opened his eyes , a warm mist of wetness hit the open areas of his face . <newline> <newline> `` What the fuck ?

He watched the street as he lit up . No sign of the van yet . He smoked two more cigarettes , flicking the butts into the road , ignored by the many cars and panel trucks .

The Times , observant in its duty to the public , was quick to inform Londoners of the locations where the flocks were roosting and provided plenteous , though dubious , methods on how to remove them . Speculation abounded in the lesser papers and spurred on by these , London was abuzz with lurid theories on the origins of the flock and what they would do next . <newline> <newline> <newline> This talk had even spread to the warm confines of the Woolsely Gentlemans Clubs on Sheffield Street , where I was staying for the fortnight and it led to a most peculiar conversation between two fellow travelers one evening . Looking back with the hindsight of 10 years , and the certain knowledge that the East Greater London Borough Grey Speckled Swallow is the same as the West Greater London Borough Grey Speckled Swallow , I am still discomforted by the questions raised by the two combatants . It is a most vexing matter . <newline> <newline> <newline> The first participant in this strange tale were William Stanley , a gentleman scientist up from Lancashire to purchase equipment necessary to his experimentation from the firm of Bellman and Grimes . He was a man of firm character - a bachelor - possessing an even temperament . I will attest to these having had the pleasure of his company for four nights prior to the arrival of Mr Smith .

They are going to say that they have the strongest political advantage in the country. They are going to say, well, they will win, but they will have no problem with the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party is not going to win. They are going to win. So if they get out of the country, they will win. But if they win the Democratic Party, they are going to win. So if the Democratic Party is winning, then they are winning. There is nothing to be gained if they win. They are losing. It's a failure. So if you look at the numbers, you see the Democratic Party wins. You know, we have the record for losing the Republican Party. The Democrats won. They lost the Democrats.

{"question": "It 's 3016 , cryogenic people are being revived for the first time .", "answer": "`` Get up ! '' A voice thundered in the cryogenic chamber . The steel vent opened and the chilling gas that was shrouding me for god-knows-how-long was being sucked out from the chamber of mine . I rolled my eyes upward . Nov. 03016. , the green neon light flickered . I gazed at the numbers once more : 3,016 . Three thousand and sixteen , huh . You could say I 've been waiting to hear that words for eight hundred years . Did humanity really took eight hundred years to find cure for nano-machine viral infection ? I pondered . I guess the nanos were pushing the boundary of the laws of physics , but I did not expect to take it so long . Also , I thought to myself , these future employee of Cryo Corp. could learn to be a bit more polite . <newline> <newline> `` I said get up ! '' a voice thundered once more . He sure was impatient . Or was it the case that the culture of future is being rude to your patrons ? I shook the frost chips off my body and began to breath manually .

In fact , the anticipation of experiencing the future was racing my heart . <newline> <newline> `` Fuckin ' get up ! '' A voice rang . A wooden stock of rifle shattered the glass of the cryogenic chamber and hit my stomach . The shards of glasses made several cuts on my arms . I groaned in pain as I vainly attempted to cover up the wounds . A big gloved hand reached me and grabbed me by the collar . The hand pulled me out of the cryogenic chamber and threw me on the dusty ground of the cryogenic chamber room . Dusty ? I ran my bleeding finger against the tile of the room . Dirt and dust and some sort of insect shells all over the floor . <newline> <newline> `` I will say this for the last damn time . Get . Up . '' said the man of the hand . He had a rifle resting on his shoulder and a thick black gas mask on his face . I reluctantly got up to my feet .

I was going to ask what happened with the Cryo Corp. but was too intimidated to ask . Even if the future is paradise and all , I doubted he broke through the chamber glass with a good intention . <newline> <newline> `` Ah , yes , yes ... These ... match up ! '' the man mumbled to himself . He tucked the profile papers under his arm pit and pointed the rifle toward me . `` Now walk , meat bag . '' I raised my hand up and started to walk toward wherever he was pointing . The cryogenic room was in shambles . More than half the chambers were broken and looted , and fluorescent light of the ceiling of the room was out . It seemed like all the cryogenic chambers were running on the emergency batteries as I was told several centuries ago . <newline> <newline> Outside , about two dozen men in black uniform trench coats and same kind of gas masks on their face awaited both of us . `` Boss ! '' said the man with the rifle behind me , `` We 've got a match ! '' The two dozen men started to separate into two groups and revealed a man sitting on a chair behind them . He alone was donned in red . As he raised himself up from the chair , the men in black knelt before him . <newline> <newline> The man in red , who seemed to be the leader of the group , opened his arm in welcome and said : `` Ah , my liver .

The birthplace of the father is now in Bellevue, New York. When the family moved to the City of New York, the family moved to Shreveport, New York in 1890. It was the daughter's birth, and the name was changed to Shreveport. The boy was born in 1889, and the family lived at the house of the namesake who was born in 1809. In 1897 the family moved to Chambard. The name Shreve was adopted as Shreve, but it was abandoned in the late 1940s. It was not until the present that the name was changed to Shreve. The name was changed from Shreve to Jadon, the son of the widow of the late Jadon, and the name of the family went to the family. They had a son named Jadon, and he was called Jadon, in 1966.

{"question": "And so he bitterly asked , `` Why ?

The butterflies stopped taunting him with their lazy twirls in the cool summer breeze .

And it was because the youth believed that it is for her to be born in a world that was not only wiser but also a world where she can be a beautiful girl. She was born to a father that was not only going to be born a girl, but also the youngest child. It is not an easy situation but one that we must understand. The man that lives in a country that is completely dependent on the international system for its socialization and development is also an amazing example for us to see how a country that is united by a very unique identity can be a unique and unique one. I hope that you will be able to watch it as I have seen it in the past. It is not going to be a new idea, but it will be something that is in the future.

{"question": "The image of a skeletal horserider appears over every major city and declares that , if three chosen people survive for the next 50 years , the apocalypse will not arrive ; it does not say who they are", "answer": "It was thirty minutes shy of fifty years since the figure had appeared in the sky portending the death of humanity . The figure rode astride a black horse , his flaming skull affixed by the horns of a stag , like a figure out of pagan folklore . Fifty years he had given them . Fifty years to ensure that three people out of seven billion would n't die . `` Who ? '' The words had been shouted to him in every conceivable dialect . In response , he had turned and ridden away . <newline> <newline> Astrid had been a child then and did n't fully comprehend what had happened . It was n't so much the horseman , but the look on her parent 's faces that foretold how much her world would change . Their fearful gazes . Their withheld tears . Those images imprinted on her memory were where it had all begun for Astrid . <newline> <newline> Things had begun in an unlikely place . Hope . Every blog , every newspaper , every broadcast , every place that served as an outlet for opinionated discussion foresaw this as a turning point . A new era of peace and involvement for all of mankind . There were calls for funding for new medical technologies , for a mandated disarmament for all countries , for aid to be provided to impoverished nations . Anything that would not have been possible before the world had a gun held to its head . <newline> <newline> But that was only the first wave and Astrid could see it had been a childish dream . The second sent terror across the world 's countries . Radicals of every background saw the event not as a warning , but as a condemnation . A harkening back to the tale of Abraham and Sodom . Seeking to be the agents of whatever gods they swore allegiance to , people took up arms against one another slaughtering indiscriminately . <newline> <newline> They were n't the only ones . Any sick and volatile degenerate who could get their hands on a weapon saw this as an opportunity . A way to leave a legacy and shape the world in a way that would have been impossible before . Astrid had spent this entire time locked in her house with her parents and it had been the worst three years of her life . <newline> <newline> At threat of extinction , governments acted with a haste that would not have seemed possible a mere five years ago . First , towns enacted martial law and barricades appeared around villages and farmers and outliers formed self-protective posses . Then counties , states , and finally countries brought the world to heel under new and often military-led programs . Personal freedoms and inalienable rights were forgotten . Or made mandatory in a way some people joked bitterly to deaf ears . <newline> <newline> The world powers formed a coalition and mandates were passed for the sake of keeping order . Any who resisted were exterminated entirely . A calculated risk , the experts called it . Provided it had n't killed any of the three , the risk seemed to pay off . Extremism and hostile governments seemed utterly absent after the culling and the world waited the next thirty five years with bated breath . <newline> <newline> The next three and a half decades had not been pleasant , but they had seen some of the positive effects of the situation . Medical research saw breakthroughs at an incredibly accelerated rate . In the wake of new medicines , people saw their lives extending into years they had n't thought they 'd had . In cases where people could n't be kept alive with medicine , iron lungs were produced in industrial quantities and set up in warehouses across the world in an effort to make sure people made it to the fifty year deadline . <newline> <newline> Third world countries saw stable governments for the first time in generations . Technological innovations were rampant . Self-driving vehicles had been implemented almost completely over a decade and roadway deaths were almost non-existent . Alcohol , cigarettes , and anything that could be abused had been effectually eliminated . Even world-wide dietary restrictions were executed and the positive impact on people 's health was immediately apparent . <newline> <newline> There were downsides to all of this . Riots sprang up as people were denied their vices but these were put down with brutal but pointedly non-lethal force . Suicide also became highly illegal with threat of discipline being enforced on the family members of those that were successful . Those that were not were often restrained in psych wards . Astrid shivered at the thought of spending thirty years in a padded room and a straight jacket . <newline> <newline> Issues that people had n't initially considered also came up . What if the three had n't been born yet ? In the wake of some sort of biblical proof , did that mean abortions could constitute murder of one of the chosen ones . The governments decided not to take any risks and made abortions illegal , but offered free sterilization in its place . If they could be judged on the possibility of someone being born or not , they may as well give up now . <newline> <newline> Although the years had stretched into timelessness , the day was finally here . Judgment day . At the second of the appointed time , the sky darkened and the horseman appeared . Everyone saw him in exactly the same way from where they stood in the streets or leaned out of windows . He gazed down at them wordlessly . Then he drew a sword from a belt on his side and pointed it towards the heavens .

Two beers is apparently more than I could handle with the rain . <newline> <newline> All that was two years ago and I still ca n't seem to let it go . My buddy Dave keeps encouraging to go out and be social again but I do n't know . I worry how Alison would feel about me trying to date again .

At this I just sat back down at the bar and ordered another drink . <newline> `` Did you see her too ? '' said a timid voice to my right . I looked over to reply and I was awestruck .

{"question": "Make us fall in love with your character , and then immediately kill them off .", "answer": "Maybe it was the brightness . Maybe it was the way it moved when she talked . Or maybe it was the way she wore it held back all the time - but I digress . There is more to this girl than just her hair . Maybe it was the fact that she always managed to find a way to smile without her lips ever budging , how she 'd make me smile without her even watching , or how whenever we 'd part ways she would do that little , like a hop-skip but only done with the toes . You know what I mean ? Everything about her was so inviting , so entrancing . I was enthralled by her very being . <newline> <newline> Something about her caused this- this change inside me . I do n't know what it was , but it was as if her mere existence caused me to wake up in the morning invigorated . I would wake to breathing stale air , step outside into the bog of life and systematically trudge my way through work and the day before coming home and washing the newest layer of rust from my skin . But it turns out , no really - it turns out there was all a purpose for this . There was a reason for me to build this chrysalis I had trapped myself in . I had indulged so much in the younger , what we could call caterpillar stage of my life , that I had this coming . Caterpillars , after all , are mindless monsters that only consume , leaving a wake of destruction in their path . I caused this life , and I was to be punished for it . I was alone for so long that my visage became that of stone , and remained that way for so long that the petrified face the world saw also became one that was petrified of the world . <newline> <newline> But then I met her . She is what sparked this change , this metamorphosis . This new beginning . A second chance . All of my transgressions would be shattered and erased as I finally break free from this self-made tomb , spread my wings and reach towards the world . The best part is , even if she does n't feel the same way , even if she does n't see in me what I see in her , all I care about is that I have her in my life . I can feel it already , my skin crawls with life as I find myself become reinvigorated . The cracks in the stone widen and so do my lips , reaching upwards along with my spirit . She has sprung me from my cage without even knowing it , and even if it takes my whole life I will repay her for that . <newline> <newline> Her arms were around me now , as we lay in her bed . They we 're wrapped tight around me , keeping me close . This feeling ? This change ? It was all meant for me . I was meant to be hers . She chose me , after all . The poison she put in me that first had be in my system for so long that the attraction I had was undeniable . Now I see that I was not the only monster , that there are things in this world that exist to keep it running the way it is . I feel her other six arms wrap around the rest of me now , holding me steady as she wraps me in her cocoon . I was so naive to think that just because she released me from my prison did n't mean she could n't put me in another . She holds me carefully , almost lovingly , as she weaves the web up my body .

{"question": "Modern civilization is wiped out , but in the future legends remain of the highly-advanced ancient civilization .", "answer": "`` Quiet , Qunitus . '' Brutus stood at the helm of the class , his armoured hand gripping the marbled podium . His naked hand was resting on the steam engine 's lever . `` We will discuss the histories of old during next period ; the Imperator insists that this demonstration takes place within the allocated break time . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> Quintus fell back into silence , as had the rest of the class . They had been taking in the large mechanical wonder behind their professor , pondering what it could possibly be . Brutus pushed the lever into position , revealing two massive infernos beneath the twin chambers resting on the iron platforms . The class gasped at the hidden fires , some edging away , while others edged closer . Within minutes of the reveal , steam began billowing out of exhaust vents as the four giant gears started to turn in unison . From overhead , light began to pour into the room - startling the students . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Do you understand what has just happened ? '' Brutus took no time to wait for an answer , assuming the class understood rhetorical nature of his question . `` The steam generated by the boiling of the water in the twin cauldrons was forced through a series of pipes and propellers , which in turn drove the gears to turn . '' Brutus walked over to the machine and pointed at the central gear pair , without taking a moment ’ s break from his speech . `` These two gears each drove the smaller gear beneath them to move the iron rods attached in such a manner that they wound the roof up . As you may have noticed , the roof has been replaced with collapsible bronze plating , to allow for such an event as this . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> None of the students understood the implications of a functioning steam engine , but the display had been completed , which was all Brutus cared for . His position was not to showcase the Imperator 's power , but to teach the youth of the empire the knowledge needed to separate them from the uncivilized heathens from which every direction was saturated with . `` If you have any questions , you may ask Professor Alexander , for he dabbles much more deeply in the sciences behind this than I . '' The class continued to murmur in awe of how steam was able to move metal , but it died down as the armoured hand of Brutus rose into the air as to silence them . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` So , as the impatient Quintus interjected with questions regarding past civilizations and our own histories , he will lead by setting the bar for basic knowledge that I will assume you all equally have . '' Motioning for Quintus to speak , Brutus pulled back the lever to silence the roaring fires behind him . `` Well ... I have an understanding of our rise to glory , but I 'm poorly equipped to discuss the ancients . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> Brutus knew that was a lie , but appreciated the desire to know that his class shared with him . `` Very well , we will start with the mightiest ancients we know of : The Romans , the Mongols , the Marvels , and the most recent to fall : The coalition of the Europeans , Americans , Chinese , and Russanadians , known as the Union Nations . '' Brutus walked over to a large granite globe , pointing at the southernmost portion of the Roman Leg . `` This is where the glory of civilization began , with the birth of Rome . We know very little of the immense empire , but we do know within years they conquered the world . The tales of Julius Caesar , who claimed all of Gaul , Igyt , and then ascending unto Divus Augustus to conquer a distant land called Olympus . Not only did he survive assassination , he then transformed a weak civilization into the strongest empire even known . '' <newline> <newline> <newline> Walking over to the now cooled steam engine , Brutus paused for a moment to appreciate man ’ s potential . `` This steam engine is n't even a seed compared to the vast tree of technological prowess the Romans achieved . It 's been far too many thousands of years to uncover any of their technology , but the Union Nations viewed the Romans with such unequivocal admiration , that it must 've been breathtaking . The Union Nations were able to place man not only on our once whole moon , but on Mars ! They lived among the stars , while creating life from machines and ripping apart the very fabric of our realm to use in war . Imagine what awe inspiring power the Romans must 've wielded .

That 's hardly enough time to- '' <newline> <newline> `` Just because Brainwaves are faster does n't mean I 'm incapable of reading a manual , '' Frost laughed , opening his briefcase and pulling out a pair of inch-thick recycled-paper manuals . `` Besides , a little old-fashioned reading and learning never hurt anyone .

Thomas and I are planning on children next summer .

Should be on a dolly outside in the security storage area . '' <newline> <newline> Glad to have something to do other than watch her friend play schoolboy , she nodded and walked briskly to the door , only hindered by the time it took to shove her key-fob into range of the receiver . `` Be right back ! '' she promised . <newline> <newline> The doctor allowed himself a long breath , at first enjoying the relative silence of the room without his intern chattering on ... but then another breath to take in the smell of real paper . God ... had it been that long since he held any ? As he mentally skimmed through the last twenty years of his practice he realized that tablets , e-ink and PDAs had pretty much handled the bulk of his work , education and leisure . Real paper , well , that was only for the occasional rare first-edition print or a sentimental greeting card . <newline> <newline> Then , as he adjusted his glasses and gazed down at the books in front of him , his smile faded . `` Nerve Dynamics D-Seven-Nine-Nine-Two Operator 's manual , '' he whispered out loud and opened the front page , skimming the disclaimers and dedications and thank yous and all the usual drivel that you could never do in a Brainwave session . He smirked at that and wondered how many high-school graduates could still recite all the publisher 's names from every course they downloaded ... likely all of them . What a nice way to be immortalized in a generation 's subconscious . <newline> <newline> As he began reading , though , he forced fanciful thought from his mind and applied his surgeon 's focus and memory to every word and every detail . He had to . It was the only way he would be able to sleep tonight and the many nights to come . <newline> <newline> Deborah came back in , pushing a squeaky-wheeled contraption under a white sterile cover . `` Got it ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Good . Sit down . You 're going to have to read these manuals too if you 're going to be my intern .

I do n't want any portion of this process to be given away to a computer . '' <newline> <newline> Deb reached up and rubbed her cheek , which seemed to be suddenly twitching a little more than usual , likely wondering if she could use it as an excuse to go home . In the end , though , the med-school credit and the curiosity of seeing such an archaic device won out and she pulled up a chair on the opposite side of the desk . `` Why ? '' <newline> <newline> Doctor Frost looked up from the book , finishing another pair of pages . `` What do you mean ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , I mean , why are you so worried about learning this yourself ? Someone 's already learned it and recorded the process .

{"question": "The apocalypse has come . The only survivors : a young child , and the monster under the bed ...", "answer": "When Johnny was a small child , he would often talk about a monster that no one else would see . Though this was normal for many children , when he turned 10 , other children would think he was too weird to hang out with , only making him need this companion more . <newline> <newline> He was an octopus-like creature covered in dark , red hair except for where his eyes and suction cups were . On the end of each of his tentacles , he had monkey-like hands with long fingers he would use to tickle Johnny . The monster 's favorite activity was to talk and he would often try to tell Johnny stories . When he was smaller , he always thought they were boring , but after a few years , Johnny became mesmerized with the monster 's stories about a landscape where there were no more humans and the legends on what happened to them . <newline> <newline> Though he would talk about many things , the monster would never say his name , no matter how many times Johnny asked him . Eventually , after being sick of calling him `` monster '' , Johnny asked him , <newline> <newline> `` Do you like the name Danny ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , there is an actor that I like named Danny . A short , bald , and fat man whom I 've been told has a voice similar to mine . He is funny . Yes , I guess I like that name . Why do you ask , John ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You 're Danny now . '' Johnny told him , to which the giant octopus laughed for a long time . <newline> <newline> `` Is it because I 'm very hairy ? '' He asked with his pale blue eyes looking humorously as Johnny . <newline> <newline> `` No , I just like the name Danny . '' So from then on , the monster 's name was Danny . <newline> <newline> Johnny 's parents were not usually around . His father would work until Johnny was asleep and his mother would usually have to go clean other people 's houses . However , every morning , Johnny 's mother and father would come into his room and give him a kiss on the forehead . One time , after that had happened , Danny had said , <newline> <newline> `` I wish they did not have to work as much . '' Johnny could not help but agree . <newline> <newline> Then , one day , they never showed up . <newline> <newline> Johnny awoke to see that a large chunk of his roof was now missing alongside the wall to the left side of his bed . Outside , where there had once been tall grasses and cotton fields were now desert . Johnny jumped from his bed immediately , screaming and crying . Danny , reached out from under Johnny 's bed and picked him up off of the floor with his long arms . <newline> <newline> `` Danny ! It 's all gone ! Mom , Dad , everything ! '' <newline> <newline> `` I know . '' Is all he said . <newline> <newline> For that first day , Johnny did not do anything . He did not move from his bed , he did not eat , and he did not even talk to Danny , as though he had been betrayed . Maybe he had ! <newline> <newline> `` How did you know , Danny ? '' Johnny asked , almost starting to cry again . <newline> <newline> `` John , I felt it , like a part of my body . '' Danny said as he got out from underneath his resting place to get a better look at his friend . He pointed in between his eyes , which Johnny now realized were bloodshot . <newline> <newline> `` I feel it here , like a headache or a tumor . When I woke up I knew they were gone . I 'm just glad you 're still here . '' He paused . `` Actually , it 's only you . '' Johnny was taken aback . <newline> <newline> `` Everything 's dead ? ! '' <newline> <newline> `` No , John . There are still animals , birds , and fish . Just no more man . Before you ask , I do n't know why , and I did not cause it . '' He almost sounded like he was pleading . <newline> <newline> `` I believe you . But what about me ? I 'm going to die here without any food or water . '' <newline> <newline> `` We will find something , John . I promise . '' <newline> <newline> It was then that Johnny first left his bed . He and Danny had agreed they needed to check the house first . It felt so surreal to open the door leading to the kitchen while the wall opposite to it was missing . <newline> <newline> There , they found enough food for the boy to survive for a month and water that neither he nor Danny knew how long would last . <newline> <newline> `` Only drink if you have to Johnny . We can not waste anything . '' Danny did not eat or drink anything , but then again , he never had before . <newline> <newline> They spent that first week together alone in the house . Somehow , the isolation felt much like Johnny 's life before , just that now he had to preserve food . After that week , Danny decided that he better go off and try to find food for Johnny . He had insisted that Johnny stay in his house in case anything happened .

{"question": "You live in a world where suicide is illegal . There is a division of law enforcement that travels to the afterlife to catch people that committed suicide and then bring them back to serve time in prison . You just killed yourself and someone is chasing you , but it 's not the cops .", "answer": "They used to say suicide never solves anything . Hah , that 's a fucking joke . The first time I killed myself was when I was 18 . Back then it was n't illegal but back then they still called it a `` medical mericle '' . I was young , it was over a girl . That time I 'm glad they brought me back . God I was dumb . But alot of things changed since then . <newline> <newline> The second time I killed myself ... Well that 's a different story . It started when my mandatory work service ended . I could not find paid work and my wife still had 2 more years of service . The government has a zero slack policy . That means If I did n't find work they would give our standard housing unit to someone who could . It 's a pre war Class A unit . BEAUTIFUL place , even has a yard like in the movies . <newline> <newline> We had one week before those fucks would take everything away . My family would probably be housed in another unit seeing as my wife still was in the system . Who knows where they would go . Probably a shitty class C unit in the pits . That 's no place to raise a child . <newline> <newline> An opportunity came up 2 days before our relocation . It was dirty and definitely not legal , but it was an out and I had to take it .

I should have thought things through but all I wanted was to be with my family . <newline> <newline> The day of the job came and the first half of the delivery went easy . The truck was unlocked like the instructions said and a forged cargo manifest on the seat . All I had to do was drive point A to point B . No problem . Well ... Slight problem .

Fuck , Why do n't I ever think things through ? <newline> <newline> My mind was racing trying to find a way out of this mess . Then it clicked.. There were like 30 bodies in the back they would never know who was the driver . In that split second of clarity I knew what I had to do . I was going to kill myself . It was the only way to save my family . What they do to a trafficker is way worse then being busted for suicide . I unbuckled my seatbelt and redirected my truck straight for the bridge .

I even managed to laugh right before I died out on impact . <newline> <newline> When I woke up my mouth tasted like I ate a big bag of assholes . Smelled almost worse .

I was expecting you. ” “ Alright I ’ ll bite ” said the brooding assassin “ How did you know I would be here . “ ” Have a seat Brackson. ” The man snapped the Glock up to Aster ’ s face in an instance . “ Where did you hear that name ? ” <newline> <newline> Aster nonchalantly walked to the decanter set on his desk “ You want a drink ? ” “ Where did you hear that name ? ” “ Now now Brackson if you would just sit down all will be explained to you. ” Aster poured two whiskeys neat , and walked one over to a small table next to a burgundy wing back , and then settled himself into the identical adjacent chair . A very on edge Brackson settled himself into the vacant wingback ignoring the drink . <newline> <newline> “ Will you lower the gun ? It 's hard for me to think with an object capable of ending life pointed in my direction. ” Brackson kept the gun fixed on Aster ’ s head . “ Talk ” said Brackson . “ Fine , have it your way. ” Aster finished off his whiskey in one long draught . “ As you must know I ’ ve come into somewhat of an interesting sum of money. ” Brackson remained silent in his stoic gun ready pose . “ The lottery commission is to pay me $ 5000 a week for the rest of my life . I will most likely live another 60 years , which puts them out roughly $ 15.6 million. ” Aster gestured to the untouched drink next to Brackson “ Are you going to drink that ? ” As Brackson handed over the glass he said “ Get to the point , I 'm losing my patients. ” Aster took the glass graciously and smiled . “ You see Brackson I cheated… Well I should say we cheated , because I had help. ” <newline> <newline> Brakson leaned forward at this confession . “ You did what ? ” he said , his gun all but forgotten . “ I cheated , I got help from someone on the inside. ” Aster took a sip from his newly gained glass of whiskey . “ It was really quite simple , I got someone on the commision to get their hands on a winning scratch ticket under the terms that we would split the winnings three ways. ” “ So you are working with two people on the inside ? ” asked Brackson , now fully intrigued by this turn of events . “ Not quite. ” Replied Aster as he finished his second beverage . “ Interestingly enough I convinced my inside man to bring up the idea of hiring you to kill me. ” <newline> Brackson sunk back into his chair mouth agape in shock . <newline> <newline> “ You did what ? ” he asked again . “ I , in a sense , am your employer Brackson. ” Brackson ’ s confused look prompted Aster to go on . “ Myself you and our inside man will be splitting my pay out three ways you see. ” Brackson suddenly coming to a realization said “ But if I don ’ t kill you the commission will just send another assassin in my place. ” “ Not if you testify against them and yourself in court , saying that you were hired to assassinate me. ” Replied Aster . <newline> “ HA ” scoffed Brackson “ and why would I ever do such a stupid thing like that ? ” “ Because I ’ ve had you followed for the last 6 months , and have enough evidence against you to put you away for life. ” <newline> <newline> Brackson shot out of his chair Glock aimed steady on Aster ’ s head . “ Give me one good reason why I should n't blow you away right now , and take the paycheck I have coming my way ? ” “ Because if anything happens to me that information will be delivered to the nearest police station , and you go to prison for life .

In other words, the narrator tries to write a story about the writing of a dying person. It is a story about a young man who lives a life that is not his own. There are many different types of writing but that is not so simple. The story is about a man who is living a life that is not like that of a man and the ways that he has shaped and changed through his life. He is a life that is filled with things that he would rather not write. There are many people who are writing to write and this makes the story of the story more complex. It is very important that the story is written to be read and put in a way that is meaningful to the reader. It is a story that is supposed to be about a man. It is about a man who is trying to be a writer in order to be a better writer. It is not about saying what he wants to say or what is meant by the title of the story. It is about the story that is being told. It is about a man who is writing a story that is about a man who is going to have to change his life.

America fell first , and Europe followed soon thereafter . Today , only Australia remains under human control .

Only two hours left until my eighteenth birthday – I can ’ t believe it – I ’ ve waited so long to join my big brother in the liberation army . When Johannes turned eighteen and unlocked his spirit shark he was instantly picked to lead his own platoon of navy seals into battle . <newline> <newline> The Rauks are a strange people . They are masters at waging war against predictable opponents ; they zone in on one species and learn everything about them , that ’ s how they defeated us so easily back in the days – and surely many other civilizations before that – they understood on a biochemical level how we operated . <newline> <newline> Now , that ’ s why Dr. Heisenbauer ’ s discovery was so important .

They are slow in that aspect . <newline> <newline> As the minutes tick away , I can feel it inside me . It ’ s been moving ever since I was born and underwent the necessary surgery .

My skin turns onyx and bristles sprout from my back . The marina suddenly shrinks as I shoot towards the sky on a set of massive wings . <newline> <newline> In the surface reflection of the sea , I see myself soaring towards the sky . I ’ m something out of an antique fairy tale – no animal that I ’ ve ever heard off – with a long scaly tail and neck , ending in a fanged maw and burning red eyes . <newline> <newline> They say as you change , part of your animal instincts take over , and I can attest to this .

He is joined by his close friend-to-be, Bob Dunning, with the loss of their own nuclear weapons. The loss of the nuclear weapons is a huge blow to the Russian nuclear industry. With over 300 million U.S. dollars, the next stage in the development of nuclear weapons, which will affect the entire world, is a fascinating story. The challenge is to realise the nuclear threat and its power to deliver it. To achieve this goal, Boris Johnson has agreed to the need of all the nations in the world to have nuclear weapons in their arsenal. This means that they have a very powerful force capable of absorbing the nuclear energy. To this end, they are given the opportunity to use their nuclear weapons, and to bring it back to Earth. The following is a summary of the pictures on the website of the Russian Federation's nuclear watchdog. The initial lead of the nuclear weapons is given to the Russian government. The opposition group, which is based in the Russian Federation, is expected to take control of the nuclear weapons. The Russian nuclear weapons program is under the control of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are the powers that control nuclear weapons. The Russian Nuclear Security Agency has an inventory of the nuclear weapons. The military is prepared to supply the nuclear weapons to Russia, but its supply of nuclear weapons is to be reduced. In accordance with the requirements of the Russian Federation, the supply of the nuclear weapons has been increased. According to the official announcement, the Russian government has promised to provide basic equipment to the Russian nuclear weapons arsenal. The nuclear weapons are designed to be fitted to a new nuclear bomb. With these weapons, the United States will have to put down the nuclear weapons and buy nuclear weapons. The United States has already started to develop new nuclear weapons. They have been designed to destroy the nuclear weapons. Russian nuclear weapons have been developed for the production of nuclear weapons.

One dusty , but oddly clean in the center of it 's binding , the far right of it 's front cover , and on the edge of each page . This particular photo album held memories that even he had seemed to have lost in the years . Among its plastic covered pages were letters whose contexts could only be assumed at that point . The detachment provided an only too certain peace , and reminded him that Time took and never gave back . Time was all anyone had , and all he wished he could get rid of . <newline> <newline> One letter from the coroner was particularly haunting . The once pure white envelope yellowed with age . The edges of which had not seen even the smallest of frays . Unopened , it whispered a reminder to him . <newline> <newline> It had been about 3 'resets ' since he had seen her . It had been 73 years or so , since he had held her hand . It had been 7 or so decades since their last fight . 26,663 days since they had made up and chatted till the morning . 639,912 hours since he had wept over her still body , when he awoke to find that her reset had failed due to complications . <newline> <newline> The millions of minutes ... the even more numerous seconds ... It all mattered little when time had lost his meaning . <newline> <newline> It had only been moments , though , since the ducts of his eyes had broken . It had only been moments since the drops parted the accumulated dust on the pages of the bound volume of memories he held in his hands . Only moments since he once again , for the 4th time that month , realized it was n't getting better . <newline> <newline> His vision blurred ... <newline> <newline> <newline> He awoke in a daze . His surroundings foreign yet familiar . <newline> <newline> He had failed her once again in a moment of weakness . For the 3rd time he had failed to wait out the 25 years . <newline> <newline> He wept as he was escorted back to his home . <newline> <newline> There , the dust collected on the tops of bookshelves pregnant with the works only one of which he had concern for . <newline> <newline> Everything was as it had been for the last century . <newline>", "pre": "If you die while you are alive, you still die.

{"question": "Due to a misunderstanding the hero arrives at the tower , defeats the princess , and marries the dragon .", "answer": "I still do n't know quite what to think about that week . Neither does Foxfire , and it 's been over forty years . <newline> <newline> For reasons owing to politics , misogyny , diplomatic relationships between duchies , and a well-meaning but totally misguided attempt by my father to keep my awful uncle 's hands to himself , my father , the king , had me sent to a remote cloistered convent called the Red Tower . As you might imagine , the building is made of red limestone . <newline> <newline> The nuns are not the stereotypical humble women in headscarves ... quite the opposite . They are the inconvenient women : too loud , too smart , too powerful , too well-educated , and , well , some of them will never consent to having a husband , if you get what I mean . The powerful men who control the Duchy could not keep their control of the Duchy if they did n't keep these women quiet , so at the first hint of any sign of independence , the daughters of the wealthy , genteel men get packed up and sent on a red horse ( it 's traditional ) to the Red Tower , never to enter polite society again . <newline> <newline> The nuns ' hands are not idle . Every inch of the Tower is covered in artwork , from carvings and frescoes to tapestries and stunning stone mosaics that one nun from far-away Persia made . Every inch of the land around the Tower is exquisitely tended to , with gardens that my childhood self could only dream of . The animal pens are clean , the animals themselves are all slick-coated and shining . The art , herbs , simples , perfumes , woolens , tapestries , and fine cheeses made by the nuns keep them living in comfort and style . Compared to the keep where I grew up , the Tower is a palace of luxury . The nuns refused to live in shit like my uncles . <newline> <newline> Neither the blessed relief of being away from my uncle nor the luxurious surrounds of the Tower were the reason I was thrilled ( privately , of course ) to be sent to the Tower . The reason I was thrilled was because I could be educated by the Librarian . <newline> <newline> The Librarian is a dragon . She is the colour of mist , with luminous green eyes matching those of her namesake . She speaks every language known to humans , including many whose last human speaker died before any living human 's grandparents were born . <newline> <newline> Anyway , enough backstory . For everyone 's convenience , especially hers , Foxfire would take a human shape to walk around the Tower . Ergonomics are a thing , and after a thousand years at the Tower , it was just easier . She was in her human form when the army attacked : stocky , of middling height , with pale skin , hair the colour of mist , and luminous green eyes , wearing the same wool robes as all the rest of us . The only obvious mark that she was a dragon was a line of faint silver scales on her brow , a crown of light . <newline> <newline> `` My lady , my lady ! '' <newline> <newline> Sister Clemente shook me awake . `` My lady ! '' <newline> <newline> I groaned and rolled over in bed . `` What 's happening ? '' <newline> <newline> `` The Tower is being attacked , '' she hissed . `` Get up , get dressed , and take shelter . '' <newline> <newline> That shook the fog of sleep off of me . `` Who ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Someone with gold and green banners , '' she said . `` An army , with pikes and horses . Get a move on , I have to wake the others . '' <newline> <newline> I jumped out of bed and started throwing on anything I could get my hands on . <newline> <newline> The Red Tower is wealthy , and this made it a target for thieves . There were numerous defences in place for the casual thief and even bands of roving robbers . Armies , though ? If an army came , though ? The plan was to lock down as much as possible , everyone take shelter , and call for help . Two hundred nuns ranging in age from sixteen to sixty plus were not a match for foot and horse soldiers , and we all know it . <newline> <newline> The stones of the floor were cold beneath my bare feet as I ran for the Library . <newline> <newline> `` Hurry , child , '' called Foxfire . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm coming , '' I panted . <newline> <newline> My job was to roll down fireproof metal doors ( built by a legendary blacksmith nun some hundred years ago ) to keep the books and manuscripts within from burning . Four , five , six , seven doors came down . They were heavy and cold and the old metal tore at my hands . <newline> <newline> `` Now what ? '' I looked around . There was no food and no water in here . And there was no good way to get to the kitchens and get some . <newline> <newline> Foxfire sighed . `` We wait . '' <newline> <newline> We waited and waited . I passed the time by looking up heraldry banners to see who was attacking us . No luck ... whoever it was either was n't in the book , or someone got something wrong . <newline> <newline> Then came the blast . <newline> <newline> I woke up on the Library floor .", "pre": "In order to reach the castle, the prince discovers that the princess is not the princess, and sends the princess to do her bidding, but the princess falls in love with the princess."}

Hands at their sides , their ever-changing faces peered at me with dead , green eyes . <newline> <newline> The bass urged me deeper and deeper into the plush walls , as it came over my shoulder . I still held the curious drink in front of me , and as the wall sucked me further back into the embrace of what was concrete a few minutes ago , I felt an unmistakable calm . <newline> <newline> The wall came over my ears and the sleepy roll of the music sunk into me . My arm was still outstretched as to keep the empty faces of the other revelers at bay - `` Look , I 've got a drink . '' It was warm inside the wall , and I let it take me . I took one last sip from the drink , my very last one , and the wall encompassed my head . <newline> <newline> I was nearly part of the wall , drink in my hand when the Bunny Rabbit emerged from the crowd and smashed the bottom of the cup back towards my head . The mysterious concoction slithered down my eyebrows and cheekbones with a sticky slink . Now , as I was becoming part of the scenery , it reminded me of a school dance . All of the kids all lined up by the giant bowl of red juice , waiting their turn to drink .

{"question": "Write a serious , adult story in a style normally intended for children .", "answer": "Wrote this for a similar prompt a little while ago , think it fits well here ! <newline> <newline> **Randy the Rhino has a Terrible Day** <newline> <newline> Randy the Rhino rose from his bed and looked out at the day . It seemed it was Monday and that wasn ’ t okay ! He couldn ’ t stay home and play as he chose , he was needed at work with his big , pointy nose . He grunted and moaned and cried in dismay , did all that he could to push the weekday away . Yet as hard as he tried , despite all that he did , the sun shining outside didn ’ t bat an eyelid . He sighed to himself , now accepting his fate , but cried one last time : who had changed the day ’ s date ? It was Sunday as the night had last come to a close , he was sure of it even as he started to doze . Yet deep down inside he knew not to debate , ignoring his work would be quite the wrong fate . <newline> <newline> Randy put on his favorite blue shorts and his favorite red shirt , then enjoyed a quick breakfast of yummy yogurt ! Although it was Monday , he now felt more alert , and stepped outside with his big smile overt . The sun was still shining and the air was quite warm , Randy ’ s neighbor Charlie was out mowing the lawn . He waved a hello , to which Randy waved back ; perhaps it was time to cut Monday some slack . <newline> <newline> Randy the Rhino walked to the concrete , enjoying the air as he came to the street . He looked both directions , eyes not missing a beat , and then ventured across on his little gray feet . He hopped up the curb and continued his way , passing by friends he saw every day . There was Gina the Gerbil and Larry the Lark , Timmy the Turtle and Sammy the Shark . And oh , who is this ? Who could it be ? It was Mary the Monkey and Billy the Bee He smiled and waved as they passed his way , their faces blank and clearly afraid . They looked so skinny , so scared and alone , an empty bag hanging from Billy ’ s arm bone . Both of them stared with eyes frozen like stone , blood-red and bare like their souls weren ’ t home . Randy laughed gleefully at their silly display and continued walking on his cheerful way . Perhaps Monday wasn ’ t the worst day ! <newline> <newline> Randy the Rhino passed by all sorts of things : From buildings and parks to plain , empty swings . He passed by crowds and houses and zoos , until he came to an alley of strange dangling shoes . They hung on a wire high up in the sky , as if someone had tried to see if they ’ d fly ! He smiled and laughed , how silly they were . Shoes were for feet , not for way above doors ! He fell to the floor and continued laughing , but stopped when he saw four feet come thrashing . They were charging his way , running with purpose ; two blurs that seemed to think life worthless . Randy rolled over to face the commotion , squinting his eyes as he set into motion . Who was that running ? Who could it be ? It was Mary the Monkey and Billy the Bee ! Randy the Rhino smiled with glee—his friends were here to see what he ’ d seen . <newline> <newline> The two kept on running faster and faster , charging straight for him – this could be a disaster ! He tried to stand up , to move far away , but his actions came just a mere second too late . Mary the Monkey and Billy the Bee came crashing down before he could flee . They covered his mouth , and as Randy cowered , he quickly discovered he was quite overpowered ! Billy then turned and presented his stinger , plunging it deep into Randy ’ s poor finger . He screamed as he felt it exit his hand , his bone snapping off as if on command . Mary laughed as he shuttered in pain , then shoved her fist almost into his brain . He screamed out for help , but nobody came , as she repeated the process again and again . He begged her to stop ; he was crying and pleading , every part of him was now badly bleeding . <newline> <newline> Billy the Bee looked down with some pity , then smiled and beat him half into the city . Mary hit next , her fists smashing a ditty , and laughed in his face as his blood became gritty . They giggled and cheered , fists flying like rockets , until Randy ’ s eyes remained still in their sockets . Together they knelt and grabbed at his pockets , digging to see if he even carried a wallet ! He didn ’ t , it seemed , but that was okay : his big , pointy nose would surely save their day . With knives and hatchets they carved quickly away , until what was his now belonged to just they . The two then stood up and went on their way , bag dripping red like a spilled Cabernet . To them it had seemed a rather successful day : For far meth this horn would pay ! <newline> <newline> Randy the Rhino lay still and afraid , the light of the day now withering away .

He thought he was cheating .", "answer": "So perfect . Standing in the kitchen , humming a tune only she knows orchestrating the rich smell of delicacies . The crackle of the fire , the sound of the wind outside , a soft chime of the bells , all seem to dance at her tune . God I love her . Words lodge in my throat and my sweat glands seem to have a life of my own every time I look at her . She sashays around the kitchen dancing on the tune she created . She looks as if she has been photoshopped in real life . Perfect hair , body face , lips , smile . Hell , her body is so impeccable that it must be chiseled by the Michelangelo himself ? I do n't know . I do n't know much about art . She does though . Oh yes , she could talk for hours about art and classical music and opera and all that . Me ? I can talk about football ... and beer . If beer is a good topic for conversation . You see , I am a regular Joe . Probably competing for the most boring person title .

Except the gem of a wife god knows how I managed to score . <newline> <newline> The train of my thought must have reached a destination beyond this dimension because it took my wife some shaking me to crash me down to this world . 'Down to earth bozo ! What are you thinking ? ! '' <newline> * '' What can I possibly think about ? Come here ! `` * I grabbed her waist and brought her down to my lap . Her lips turned to express mortification but her eyes gave her away . <newline> `` What are doing ? Stop being a caveman bozo !

Perfect . Did I say that ? <newline> <newline> My wife has a habit of sleeping early . And I know it 's going to sound weird but we sleep in different rooms as well . Maybe a lot of couples do this but once I made a mistake of sharing this with a friend and boy did I never heard the end of it . `` She 's using you . `` , `` She must be cheating with someone , '' `` She 's weird . Break up with her ' . <newline> No thanks . Initially even I thought it was weird but our sex life is hot and she is 11 on a scale of 10 , so who am I to complain ? So here I am dozing off on the sofa trying to watch some shit show on the TV . I am almost asleep but the dull thud of the clock as the time turns 10 breaks through the fabric of my dreams . My reverie 's broken , my veins are filled with a newfound zeal and lively sweat glands are back . <newline> <newline> `` Hey . '' <newline> <newline> She 's here . Now this is the part where logic escapes me . And I let it . Standing in front of me is a woman who makes my heart beat in a rhythm possibly impossible for a human being . And she 's not my wife . In fact she is opposite of my wife . She has unruly hair , a freckled face with signs of past pimple breakouts , and a very ... normal body . Like she has tummy fat and heftier thighs , unshaved legs and her own body smell . Just like magic she comes every night and disappears like magic in the morning . At first I used to get alarmed and thought about calling the police . But maybe it was something in her voice , or the loneliness that lurked in her eyes that stopped me from doing that . <newline> <newline> * '' Hi'* <newline> `` May I join you ? What are you watching ? '' <newline> * '' Eh nothing . Just flipping through channels '' * <newline> `` Mind if i join you ?

And that talking evolved to laughing , teasing and munching popcorn . She was snuggling up to me , her face towards me beckoning me to kiss her . Her smell was n't helping at all . This is wrong ! My goddess is lying in the next room . Next room ! And here I am sitting with some god-knows-who strangers thinking about all the unspeakable things . I love my wife . So why does this feels so right ? <newline> <newline> So I plunged my lips and drank her . All of her . Her taste , he scent , everything . I was drowning and she was my raft . We kissed each others marks , freckles . Explored every nook , revised every secret . I reveled in her imperfections and reached heights I did not know existed .

{"question": "Every time you close your eyes , you become an animal .", "answer": "Julius gazed into the night sky from the trough of a snowy bank . Thick snowflakes gently danced on their way down , softly blanketing the Earth with a layer of snow . He could see pin-points of light occasionally peer through the clouds polluted with a distant city 's lights . He imagined the people who lived there , those who would worry about work , bills , or even staying warm . But he was warm here , treated to a thick fur coat that was just starting to accumulate with snow . He was unburdened , his stomach full . <newline> <newline> 'Is this just a dream ? ' Julius thought to himself . The answer escaped him , and he settled on the fact that he did n't want to know . <newline> <newline> He went to crawl up the hill , and his legs were blocked by something soft . He looked down . A dribble escaped his mouth and fell onto a leather backpack that was camouflaged with the quickly mounting snow . Embarrassed , he tried licking his lips to stop himself from drooling again . His own lips tasted of heaven . <newline> <newline> He thought , 'Is this backpack mine ? ... No , I do n't remember bringing a backpack here . ' He turned around , and maybe due to the majesty of the tundra ’ s expanse , he felt for a brief moment as though his coat tail might actually be a tail of his own . He scouted behind him for anybody nearby and his eyes fell onto a man lying in the snow ten feet away . The body was n't moving . He was overcome with panic . He quickly approached the man and attempted to speak , but only a whimper found its way out of his throat . <newline> <newline> The man was lying in a pool of dark fluid . Julius lowered his head to sniff , and it smelled familiar . The aroma reminded him of the taste on his lips . Just as he thought this , another dribble escaped from his mouth . At that moment he saw it . The bloody entrails that had been picked apart by a beast . The man 's insides were almost completely eaten . <newline> <newline> Julius went to give out a scream , and all he did was howl . <newline> <newline> Julius soared out of the winter landscape , and woke up in a sweat . It was day time and the heat of the sun was beating down on his face through his window . The humidity was causing the wallpaper to peel away from the walls . The air was thick and stuffy . He turned to the clock , and rubbed his eyes . The window air-conditioner was running , but it did n't feel like it . His shirt stuck to his back . Bed covers were on the floor . <newline> <newline> He took a second glance at the clock through the tiny crust gripping onto his eyelash . '7:00 ' <newline> <newline> `` Seven o'clock ! Crap ! '' He threw himself to his feet . His balance was a bit off , and he fell to all fours . A flash of the dream came rushing back to him . Violently , he shook his head , telling himself it was just a nightmare . He stood again to sprint towards the door . `` Socks ! '' He turned his feet sideways to stop himself , and stumbled as he pivoted backwards . He rushed back and scooped up some socks from the laundry bin . Julius nimbly hopped on one foot towards his shoes while putting the socks on his feet . He jumped into his shoes , wriggled his heel down , and swung the door open . <newline> <newline> The door bounced and an elderly voice shouted , `` Hey , watch it ! '' Julius peeked around the old wooden door into the hall and saw Mrs. Hibbit pulling her little runt of a dog back with a blue leash to prevent it from getting struck . <newline> Julius half-heartedly apologized , as he closed the door . He casually asked , `` How 's the old man ? '' Mrs. Hibbit grunted , and walked right past , sticking her nose up . She boorishly called her Pomeranian as she tugged on his collar . The leash even matched the woman 's over-sized , flowery dress , and purse , and eyes ... it was an eyesore . The dog walked on the opposite side of Julius , tangling his legs in a blue trap . He hopped over the leash , and quickly started for the exit of the apartment again . <newline> <newline> On his way out , Mrs. Hibbit opened her door and Julius could hear the exacerbated coughs of Stephen Hibbit , the woman 's husband , from inside . Steven was the only tenant of his entire building that he could actually tolerate , but recently Julius had n't seen him due to an illness that befell him . He just hoped for the best for Steven . <newline> <newline> Skipping breakfast was not something Julius would usually do , but his boss was not happy with him as it was , so he ran right past the cafe he would normally sit down at , in hopes to still make it to work early .

You are training to become a firefighter", "answer": "**Lesson 1 : Fire does n't care** <newline> <newline> Fire does n't have an objective . It does n't have a strategy or a plan . It does n't even hate you , Fire does n't have feelings . Fire burns to make more fire , like a plague makes more and more people sick . A plague does n't care about who or why , it just cares that it is spreading . Fire is a plague . <newline> <newline> **Lesson 2 : Fire can be hurt** <newline> <newline> Fire is too simple to know it , but it can be hurt all the same . Kick at it 's heart , and snuff out it 's very essence . Use your boots , when you can , keep your face away from the flames . Use your hands , if you have to , it is better than letting fire spread wildly . Use your body , if you must . To protect those whom we are sworn to rescue . To protect our brothers in arms . <newline> <newline> **Lesson 3 : Rely on your brothers . Rely on yourself** <newline> <newline> -- - <newline> <newline> Those were the only three lessons that were given to us , before we were sent into a conflagration . There was also a lot of physical training , certainly , to the point that I could accurately throw a flying kick to any surface from shoulder level down . I could even use my gloved hands with such speed and accuracy that the flames never seemed to touch them . Of course , the training grounds were nothing like the field . In the field ... strange things happened . <newline> <newline> In the field , Fire is more alive . It is not like the captive fire that we create and promptly snuff out in our barracks . It is not even like the careful , tentative fire that we fought on our graduation exam . In the field , Fire is more primal , more raw ... more violent . It pretends to be snuffed , only to bounce back a moment later . In training they told us never to turn our back to Fire . In the field , we learned just how hard it is to follow that maxim . But we fight on . <newline> <newline> We fight on because there is no hiding from Fire , not if we let it grow . We fight on because we are the only wall to protect our families from this inferno . We fight on , because there is no better choice . Once upon a time , I heard , they used water to douse the flames . Water , such a precious gift , wasted so recklessly . We fight on , with parched throats and dry eyes , because only after a successful day in the field will we be given our water rations to share with our loved ones . Meagre as they are , we fight on because to stop would be to die .", "pre": "to achieve your dreams."}

{"question": "A fairy tells it 's children a human tale before bed", "answer": "The warm light of Haze ’ s children flickered over her skin and across the craggy walls of the treehome . Her smile , hidden in the near darkness except when one of the children played over her delicate features , was joy mixed with the bittersweet understanding of every parent : that soon the brightest things in her life ( literally , in her case ) would be torn away by time , and that every moment with her children was precious as a glowing hearthcoal in the grip of darkest winter . <newline> <newline> The oldest ball of light , who was named Ripplewater after the pond where she ’ d mated , just the one time , with his father , was already starting to take on material forms . He astonished her with his ability to hold these forms for several standard droplet-falls ( this was a preferred unit of time in their part of the forest ) before he faltered and flickered back into a dancing ball of light . Haze tried to coax him into the human-like form that for eons had been the tradition of her race , but Ripplewater preferred to mimic the sparrow and the titmouse . <newline> <newline> “ Do you want to hear a story ? ” Haze murmured into the darkness , holding out a hand for one of her youngest , Snow , to play across her fingertips . She had grown used to talking aloud like this , talking into the darkness while her children expressed their pleasure or dissatisfaction in movement and modulations of brightness . <newline> <newline> “ About humans ? ” said a little voice , startling her . It was Ripplewater , of course ( Haze was not yet accustomed to hearing and seeing him thus ) . In the light his siblings cast , Haze could see that for now he looked like a tiny human boy , sitting cross-legged upon a ledge of peeling wood . Ah ! The stories were paying off . <newline> <newline> “ Yes , my honeysuckle flower , ” Haze said softly , though her heart beat hard with pride . “ Just one , and then I will sleep. ” Light beams didn ’ t sleep . They would swarm around her in the night , waiting for her to awaken with the rising sun . <newline> <newline> “ Once , ” she began , “ there was a little human larva named Internet . Like all humans , Internet lived in a great big forest made of rocks that were all stacked on top of each other and hollow inside , like enormous stony trees without any branches or leaves. ” It was hard to make sense of such fanciful nonsense , but this was how Haze ’ s mother had described them a long time ago , and Haze had to admit that it *sounded* rather romantic ( until you really thought about it ) . <newline> <newline> “ Internet ’ s forest was called City . And in the middle of City was the biggest stone tree of them all . *So tall* that the pointy thing at the top almost poked a hole in the sky. ” <newline> <newline> “ If it poked a hole in the sky , ” piped Ripplewater , “ would all the stars fall out ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Nobody knows , ” said Haze . She put a finger to her lips and continued . “ So one day Internet decided to climb to the tippy top of the Great Stone Tree . Yes , my little mossflowers , humans have to *climb* because they are *sticky* . They stick to the earth and anything on top of it , like a mouse or a deer or a gecko does . They can not fly like you or I. ” Ripplewater ’ s wide eyes reflected the light of the others , who were almost motionless around him in their attentiveness . <newline> <newline> “ So it was very hard for Internet to reach the top of the Great Stone Tree . For many phases of the moon , he climbed up the inside of the tree . He passed many strange and wonderful things on his journey , like a *plastic* and a herd of mighty *cellphone*. ” The human words were harsh in her mouth , but they savored of faraway lands and exotic human magics , recalling the innocence and wonderment of her own childhood . “ But I ’ ll save the tales of his exploits for another night. ” Sleepiness was getting the better of Haze , and she knew that Ripplewater must be growing tired of maintaining his physical form . It was time to wrap things up . <newline> <newline> “ When Internet got to the top of the stone tree , he stepped out of the *window* and stood on the top to look around . Everything looked so small to him , so far below ! You know what that ’ s like , children , but for Internet it was very surprising . And Internet was so excited that he started to dance . He danced with such wild joy that he forgot to watch where his feet were sticking . And do you know what happened ? ” She waited a moment , but Ripplewater said nothing . “ He danced off the top of the Great Stone Tree and fell all the way back down . If a fairy fell like that—if a fairy could fall—we would simply shatter into little pieces of light . But humans , like sparrows and beetles and foxes , are full of dirt and red water . So when Internet crashed into the earth , he burst open like a rain droplet and all his dirt and water went flying everywhere !

{"question": "The sun has just risen for the first time in 14 years", "answer": "The last time I had seen it I was only four years old . <newline> <newline> And as with any memory , it faded with age until all i was left with was a vague image and the fleeting feeling of warmth . It was the feeling that had stayed with me all these years , like a memory that my skin held onto , the warm kiss of the sun 's rays , and ever since it had craved for more , always there in the back of my mind , a hunger that may never be sated again . Humans need sunlight . That was what I was told . But we do n't always get what we need . And so I 've lived with the thirst for fourteen long years now . <newline> <newline> I have lived underground for all of my life along with the rest of humanity . No one knows why we did . Those are memories long past and forgotten . But we do know a little of the world as it was before the Darkness took over . Few photos and books have survived , but those that did painted a much more vibrant picture of the earth , filled with greenery and light , warmth and a life above ground , animals and seasons and weather , of cities that grew up instead of down . <newline> <newline> I had lost myself in the stories far too many times . I knew them all by heart . There was n't much else to do in the colony otherwise besides working and surviving day by day . There were few kids my age growing up and even still kids are few and far between . Mother told me that people have given up , that our time is coming to an end and we too shall be just a memory .

Thirsty for the sun . <newline> <newline> The sun . <newline> <newline> It invaded my thoughts almost daily . It was like a sliver of hope for humanity . If the sun came back , maybe , just maybe we could claw our way back from the brink of extinction , live life the way it was supposed to be lived . But there was no hope and mine was dwindling as well . <newline> <newline> I dreamed nightly of green as far as the eye could see , of warmth that soaked down into my bones chasing the chill away . It was hard for me to imagine , the only references I had to go on were old and faded , memories of memories . <newline> <newline> The last time the sun rose it was only briefly , teasing us with a hope that was soon dashed mere hours later as it set once again . The whole colony gathered around the atrium under the great glass dome . Bright orange light had melted the ever present layers of ice and snow enough to stream rays down into the colony . everyone avoided it at first , then slowly , one by one we each took turns stepping into the bright column of light . My eyes stung and I had to squint when it was my turn . I had never felt anything like it before in my short life , but my body seemed to know that this is what it was missing . How could we live without something so essential to who we are as a species ? <newline> <newline> And then it was gone .

My heart aflutter , I quickly dressed and joined the masses as the gathered around in a circle under the glass dome . <newline> <newline> At first I did n't see it , and then all at once I did and all the memories from the last time washed through me , enveloping me in their fuzzy warmth .

{"question": "Write about your most recent dream .", "answer": "I was led to the entrance of the cave where the young couple lived , carved into a hillside near a river . They were two carefree young people—hippie types , perhaps in their early thirties . They were not much older than me , really ! <newline> <newline> The entrance passageway was constructed of natural orange-brown rock , sloping steeply downwards and then breaking into into a set of about 5 steps placed at a ridiculous forward angle . The end of the passageway was solid rock and the actual entrance was on the left . <newline> <newline> I felt myself stumbling slightly on the lose stones that were strewn across the entrance floor , trying to grab onto something to stop myself from falling . `` Would you like us to extend the ladder ? '' She asked cheerfully . `` Ladder ? What on earth is there a ladder for ? '' I thought . The slope of the passageway was steep , sure , but it was still more horizontal than vertical , and a ladder seemed ridiculous ! <newline> <newline> I declined the ladder , but by this stage she had already pressed the button on her remote anyway , and a wooden ladder on a rope pulley slid toward me on my left . As it turned out , it was n't a ladder along the floor of the passageway , but more of a makeshift banister that I could grab on to to steady myself ! Or so it would have been , had I not now reached the top of the treacherous stairs , where annoyingly , the `` ladder ” stopped . I put my arms out like a tight rope walker , and carefully traversed the steep angle of the stone steps , egged on by the hippie couple with so many words of encouragement . They were already down you see ; in fact they 'd been down the entire time ! Apparently , getting into this ridiculous place was second nature to them ! <newline> <newline> By now I was leaning forward and struggling to contain the force of gravity pulling me down . I leaped over the last obstacle and had to slow my running motion from the momentum . The hippie couple clapped and cheered at me in a rather patronizing way – the way you congratulate a child for achieving something for the first time . I was n't impressed . <newline> <newline> They led me into their home through the entrance on the left . Inside was a mixture of dated , unassuming pine furniture , like a dining table with two chairs , some shelves , and then a basic kitchenette with a little breakfast bar carved out of the rock . The kitchenette stopped at a wall on it 's far end , but the wall did n't extended to the other side of the cave , rather leading to another passageway which had what I assumed to be the master bedroom at the end of it . The place had no flooring to speak of , just the dusty ground ; and the walls and ceiling were just the uneven , bare rock with the occasional picture frame , and number of shelves attached to the rock walls . But what the place lacked in terms of carpets or paint , it made up for in the little trinkets that they had presumably took home from their travels all over the world . <newline> <newline> I picked one up off the shelf . It was a blue skull , formed out of some sort of plastic mesh ; so it was not completely solid , even a little fragile looking . The mesh design was uneven and created a series of intricate , repeating patterns that made it look rather beautiful . “ Do you like it ? ” He asked . “ We got it on our trip to Mexico ! They were celebrating a local custom called the day of the dead , where they honor their close friends and relatives who have died ! They were selling these at the market ! ” “ Y-yeah , it 's very cool ! ” I said shyly . “ Tea ? ” she asked . “ Oh.. erm.. Yes please ! ” They both did n't say anything more to me while I explored the room . Despite all this ruggedness , I was starting to feel a cozy sense of home in this place ! <newline> <newline> Now , I should point out that I do n't actually know these people . I 've never met them before today , and I do n't even recall how I became acquainted with them , or why I was invited to their place . The whole thing seemed a little surreal , and the thought that it might be a dream cropped up in my mind ! But dreams are illogical , they do n't follow a coherent story ; they tend to change and morph and jump around . This whole sequence of events , while strange indeed , still followed a logical , linear story . Besides , you can control what people say in your dreams , and I could n't control what they said to me or to each other . Every now and then they would talk to each other in another language , and I could n't influence when they spoke or what they said , with my mind . I could n't influence anything that happened at all , and that 's why I concluded that it could n't possibly be a dream .

An additional cause of the disease is genetic variation. It is often a disease when a person is an individual. In some cases, genetic mutations can cause a mutation. It is caused by genetic mutations. The most common genetic variants in children are hereditary diseases. As a child, one of the main reasons for the disease is that it is one of the most common disorders. One of the most common hereditary diseases is the appearance of the nymphs. This condition is common in children and has a very high chance of developing a rare disease. Currently, it is common for individuals with a genetic mutation to have hereditary diseases. As a result, it is not surprising that a person with a hereditary condition with hereditary diseases may have a rare genetic disease. However, people with hereditary diseases are usually not able to give sufficient medical care. This is one of the reasons why people with the disease can develop an illness. However, children with hereditary diseases will also be exposed to diseases such as cancer. Many people with hereditary diseases have a condition called \"chronic fatigue syndrome\". Another common cause of a rare disease in which the disease is not inherited is the presence of a protein called a quorum of the bacterium. This condition can be prevented by the use of medicines and the lack of an active disease condition in the patient. In this article, we will also discuss the condition of a person with a genetic disorder. On the other hand, many people who are in a chronic condition have hereditary diseases. After a severe infection, one of the relatives is prone to a disease that is usually acute. However, as a disease progresses, the disease progresses, and the disease can still develop. The disease is not really complicated, and therefore, the condition can be a little different. If the condition is severe, then the disease may occur as an acute condition. However, this condition is not very rare. It is a disease that affects more than one person. If a person with a hereditary disease is diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, it is possible to develop a condition that has a very simple genetic function. The condition will affect many people. Some people may develop a very rare disease. The cause of this condition is usually the causative disease. This disease usually affects a person in a way that is related to the disease.

{"question": "It was either my life or hers . Unfortunately she chose mine .", "answer": "It had been an eternity since we got a horde of zombies attacking our camps . At this point in the apocalypse , we knew that there probably were n't many survivors left . Something they never told you in the movies was that zombies can go extinct too . It takes a lot longer , but they do . Apparently plants or animal meat was n't enough to keep zombies going , because after a few months without fresh zombie meat , they start eating each other until there 's only one of them left and ca n't eat anything else anymore . We found out by experimenting with zombies . We had to find out more about them to try to find a cure , but after 25 years of undead chaos , we did n't really care anymore . We did n't find a cure and we had gathered a small group of survivors to at least try to get human kind back on track and not make the same mistake . The order was easy this time : 'Shoot them all till there 's no undead left ' . The amount of people we lost due to trying to catch enough for the cure and experimenting with them was too big . It was time to create a safe place for everyone . <newline> <newline> My daughter put on her coat . 'I 'm coming with you . ' <newline> Her face was resolute , but my opinion was more resolute than that . 'Oh no , you 're absolutely not coming with anyone . You stay put .

' Fred had a concerned look on his face . 'We 're about to kick some zombie ass , we all need to concentrate and not turn into a rotten piece of flesh . ' Fred had been my first ally , back when it all started . He was the one who got him through the time after Heather died . His wife Mona and him had taken him and Holly , who was 5 at the time , into their home . They treated Holly like their 3rd child , which really helped her deal with the loss of her mother , something nobody should ever even have to deal with till they 're old . We lived in a cruel world though . <newline> <newline> The horde hit the outer barrier we set up . Some of them died due to the electric fence , but the next few climbed over their zombie friends to get over it . There were still at least 200 of them last . Our snipers took out a few more . They had to get closer for us to kill them with our assault rifles . Another one of my mates died on a scavenger hunt on one of these things . He found the rifle in an empty house , but then found out it was n't empty . The guy the rifle belonged too stabbed my friend in the back , without even trying to ask any questions . The rest of the crew immediately shot the guy , but my friend lost too much blood . We do n't need people who make rush decisions , we want some reasoning . A few zombies made it close enough .

{"question": "My cat comes home nearly every morning with cuts and scratches all over . Write about what he could be getting up to on his nights out .", "answer": "By day I am one being but by night I am another . I have two lives , two missions , two families . In the daylight I am Whiskers , friend to the humans who live in this house , but at night I am Shadowswipe and I fight to defend our land . <newline> <newline> As night falls I am called to the borders of my land where I meet Razorpounce and Deathclaw , my brothers in my nightly duties . These two warriors have been my brothers for many a year , Deathclaw living next door since long before I was born and Razorpounce a new addition at number 32 when I was still but a trainee under Deathclaw myself . <newline> <newline> Together this small band defends the homelands against interlopers , the ones who would pull our lives to the ground and shit on them like cheap kitty litter . Together we are the Brotherhood . <newline> <newline> That night our patrol had begun as it always did . We sat on the fence at number 16 and looked out over the great dark road . Across was the Deadlands , an area where no cat could go , as it was infested with that most vile vermin , dogs . The Deadlands are not our great fear though , the dogs are slaves to the humans and humans are too stupid to invade other territory . No the Deadlands is almost a boon , a rock to brace our back against when all around the world attacks and to say *no more , this is as far as we shall be pushed* . <newline> <newline> The evening was quiet , peaceful , silent . Lights from houses flickered on and off and we moved along the western edge , keeping a look out , but seeing and hearing nothing . As we passed into the sacred woods we made the sign of the beast , three scratches in the earth , to show humility and honour to our dead . <newline> <newline> Tonight Deathclaw halted us not far into the woods , he was hungry and so we spaced out and soon had each taken down a mouse or shrew and sat happily chewing our way through them . Finishing we moved on , towards the centre of the woods where the edge of our territory lay and we would mark the demarcation , to ward off anyone who would pass near and be unaware this that was our land . Soon we were on the way back to the houses , the woods clear and the rodents cowed for another day . <newline> <newline> Passing back into the gardens we felt it immediately , something had changed . A scent lingered on the air and the noise was different . The *feel* in our whiskers was different . Deathclaw did n't need to say anything but Razorpounce and I moved off quickly , he taking the Northern Fence and I moved up onto the bungalow guttering , each of us straining our senses to find what it was that had changed . <newline> <newline> Deathclaw took the dangerous path , as he always did . He walked through the middle of the gardens , fur fluffed , but passing confidently past hedge and bush , daring whatever it was to come at him . We reached number 41 before we felt it again , whatever it was had drawn close and a sudden chill had come across the gardens . Even the faint noises of bats had gone from the distance , it was deathly silent . <newline> <newline> Deathclaw stopped , sniffed the air and then leapt onto the birdbath , allowing him some height against whatever was in the dark . When it came forward we all saw and smelled it at the same time , how it concealed itself before I have no idea but suddenly it was overwhelming and all consuming . <newline> <newline> It was the largest fox I have ever seen in my life and had strolled into the garden and now sat , beneath the birdbath , staring up at Deathclaw . Deathclaw was not a small cat , in fact he was one of the largest and strongest I have ever known , but this fox was vast . It was the size of a Doberman and had scars criss-crossing his face showing he was no stranger to fighting . <newline> <newline> Casually he stood and then lifted a leg and pissed in the grass and the scent of `` MINE '' filled the air . Deathclaw was a tactician , a careful fighter , but this deliberate insult was too much and with a yowl he was in the air , claws extended and swiping across the foxes face , before he could even finish the piss . <newline> <newline> The fox was taken aback , used , I suppose , to fighting on his own terms , but this did not last long . He snapped out at Deathclaw and missed him by a hair and then snapped again at his tail . Deathclaw was not so foolish to be taken like that , we had all fought foxes over the years but never one like this , never such a beast . <newline> <newline> I moved down , getting closer as quietly as I could .

Wailing started to emerge when one of the villagers had translated the command to the rest of the inhabitants . « I said open fire on the villagers , is that understood ? » The commanding officer shouted , repeating his command . A collective , but hesitant « Yes sir » could be heard across the town square and soldiers started to take aim.One platoon began herding people together , shooting those who didn ’ t comply and those who did . Gunfire was getting louder and more frequent . The sergeant who had been standing close to me had gone over to the commander and was shouting at him to stop this madness . The commander not seeming to care , unholstered his pistol and without flinching he cocked the gun and blew out the brains of the sergeant . The message was clear , do as he said or end up like the sergeant . I took my gun of my back and hoisted it so I could aim . In my hands I had a death-bringer , a life-releaver , an automatic delivery system of death and misery . I forced myself to become a machine , an insensitive war-machine who fulfilled the commanding officer ’ s perverted desire for violence . I walked over to the group of people now standing in a long line against the wall . I took aim and started firing . *Click , click , click* , the sound of the mechanics in the gun was the only thing I heard . A grey concrete I was painting red was the only thing I could see . Pain , sorrow , anger , sadness the only emotions I felt . I hated myself for not being brave enough to confront the Commander like the sergeant had , but I was a coward . The wall behind the victims , the so-called enemies who threatened the western world ’ s existence by existing , was now chipped and red . Screaming , crying and horrific noises weren ’ t coming from the inhabitants of the village , but from the soldiers pulling the triggers . I snapped out of my trance-like state when my gun stopped firing . No more ammo , and no more people . I sat down , let my tears blend with those of the villagers , cursing the Commander , the western society , and god himself .

{"question": "Make a fictional meal , dish , or drink sound so good that I 'll want to lick your words right off my monitor", "answer": "Captain and warcaster Aeron Pike sat crouched in the narrow confines of the Cygnaran trench , his knees drawn up towards his chest and custom made scattergun propped next to him in the brushwood reinforced firing bay . <newline> <newline> Far away to the west there was the distant crack of gunfire ; likely a few Long Gunners who had seen a fleeting fur cap of their Khadoran foe . But where the warcaster was it was pleasantly quiet , or at least as quiet as the front lines of any active battlefield could be . No Assault Kommado 's gas grenade landing at his feet , no Widowmaker a hundred yards away with their lethal crosshairs on him , and no damn Khadoran warjack coming his way . Creator help him , it was the best he had it in weeks . <newline> <newline> If it was n't for the damn iron rations . <newline> <newline> A can of bully beef , the canned meat loomed unappetizingly on his mess kit . Besides it was what the can swore was vegetable stew . Pike personally never saw the similarities ; brown and salty did not a stew make . If he 'd been served this in any tavern at Point Bourne , the Captain likely would 've dunked the cook in his own poison . But alas , in battle one was far less particular about their fare , and counted every meal as a blessing . <newline> <newline> `` Pass me some of that sheet iron , Capt , will you ? '' The Trencher Sergeant across from Pike said . <newline> <newline> The veteran soldier had a similar stomach churning meal in front of him , his Model 4 Spoon flashing as he shoveled the apparently edible food into his mouth . The Captain , his frown worsening as he stared down at his plate tossed the wax paper wrapped hard tack to the NCO who gnawed on it with relish . <newline> <newline> `` What 's the matter , Sir , not hungry tonight ? '' <newline> <newline> The warcaster shook his head , running a filthy hand through his equally filthy brown hair . <newline> <newline> `` Nah , just taking my time . Could lose a tooth otherwise ... or my lunch . '' <newline> <newline> `` Thinking 'bout those fancy meals you had growing up ? '' <newline> <newline> Pike laughed , the only merry thing for miles in this hellish land of rusted barbed wire and unburied corpses . <newline> <newline> `` Hardly . My family were freeholders in the Watcher Peaks . We had it better than most but it was still a hard living , Menoth grant it . But it was honest . That said ... I 've had my share of wining and dining . Truth be told , I dislike most of it . '' <newline> <newline> `` Pretend you do thought , Sir , and I 'll live vicariously through you . '' <newline> <newline> Captain Aeron Pike smiled , taking a sip of his overboiled tea . <newline> <newline> `` Let 's see ... there was the time I was invited to dine at Fort Whiterock . Duke Mordin was pleased to hear that a warcaster had discovered within his Duchy and sent an invitation to Point Bourne while I was still a lieutenant at the academy . Me , this twenty year old Corporal turned officer invited by one of the most powerful men in the kingdom . Anyways , they sent a carriage to pick me up after I got three weeks leave and took me to Fort Whiterock . Now , its not any Ceryl to be sure but still . It 's impressive . The had this dish that I ca n't for the life of me remember its name . But it was apparently some Caspian fare . Roasted goose stuffed with spices from the lands of Zu , covered in some light chile glaze of sorts . Apparently it was a joke of sorts to give the hottest piece to the youngest person there : me . It took me two cups of ale before my tongue stopped burning . After that , they had those little sweet cakes with that really hard icing on it , fondant or whatever its called . Truth be told , it was rather bad ; too sweet for my taste . But the girl I was with , the Baron of Rosaleen 's daughter she liked it . Being young and impressionable , I naturally agreed with her like a fool . Still , it was worth it .

{"question": "After dying , God asks you : `` So , how was heaven ? ''", "answer": "I opened my eyes . It must have been night , because the room had gone dark , and I was still lying on my bed . *Guess I botched the job after all . * Without getting up , I reached across with my left hand for the revolver on my night stand . *If at first you do n't succeed ... * <newline> <newline> I groped for the table , but my hand whiffed as it passed through the space where it should have found the smooth wooden surface of my night table . It was gone . I sat up in my bed , and reached across to hit the light switch , but the walls were bare and switch was missing . It was at that moment that I realized I was no longer in my bedroom . <newline> <newline> “ Looking for this ? ” a soft voice called from the far end of the room . In the darkness , I could just barely make out the silhouette of a tall slender man , holding my revolver . <newline> <newline> “ Yeah , '' I answered , uncertainly . `` Uhh ... am I dead ? ” <newline> <newline> “ A better question is , when have n't you been dead ? ” The shadow appeared to be studying my revolver with great interest . <newline> <newline> *What a wise ass . * “ I 'll take that as a yes , ” I said , in no mood for riddles . “ Does that make you God ? Or someone else ... ” my voice trailed off at the realization that I may not have exactly been a model citizen while alive . <newline> <newline> The silhouette chuckled , a bit sadly . “ Do not worry , child . I am not one to fear. ” He sat down at a chair at the far end of the room . “ So , how was Heaven ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Huh ? ” I asked him , confused . “ I 've never been to heaven .

Or what about having the privilege of bailing my dad out of jail once a month , was that part of heaven too ? ” Words were coming much faster now . “ Almost forgot to mention watching cancer eat away at my mother , the only person that ever cared about me in my life . Thanks for that. ” I wiped hot tears from my face , as I realized that ending my life had done nothing to curb all the hatred that I had felt in my heart . I was furious , and the man responsible for all my suffering was standing before me . “ You have got some kind of sick sense of humor , you know that , you son of a bitch ? ” <newline> <newline> I began to ransack the room frantically , looking for anything heavy to throw at the manifestation of all my anger . “ Here , let me help you , ” he said gently , holding out my revolver . <newline> <newline> I wrenched the weapon from his hand , pointing it straight at his chest with a shaking hand .

How the hell is anyone supposed to make one place that satisfies everyone 's desires ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I tried ...

He broke open the bone of his turkey leg , holding one sharp end in each hand and eyes the pulsating neck of the viking to his left . <newline> <newline> Martin stabbed , shoving the bone into the jugular vein and tearing it downward . The other viking seated on Martin 's left drew his axe but not before Martin stabbed him in the kidney and moved to strike his jugular . This might be easier than he thought . <newline> <newline> As the second viking fell , Martin heard the cool rush of iron through the wind behind him . That was it , he 'd already lost .

A fault that was too costly to fix in manufacturing , but a work around made the weapon still field ready in such instances . It could no longer spin up the projectiles , but it could still pack the punch behind them . No longer capable of fully automatic fire , it became a hand held artillery gun . Seeing the smoke , his commanding officer yanked the gun from Tucker 's hands and shook his head . <newline> <newline> `` Rookies . '' <newline> <newline> Tucker joined the army because it was the only profitable thing that was left to do . In training , he got a few choice nicknames for his ability to seize up his weapons . Instructors ' yelling did n't seem to sink into his head so he 's keep firing until both barrels would stop spinning . He 'd look up the sky and shake his head , the clomping of the instructor 's boots always meant a chewing out . <newline> <newline> `` Damn it , son ! How many is that this week ? Rampart Corp has been in existence for near three hundred years and you 're single-handedly bankrupting the entire outfit ! '' The instructor tore the gun out of Tucker 's hands . <newline> <newline> Tucker chose the Rampart Corporation because the qualifications were the most widespread . He did n't do well in the other other of the hundred jobs he 'd applied for . The things he did manage to do were menial , which meant enough for only him in his life . Tucker needed a little more , there was someone new in his life . He tried , he really did , but he failed out of everything else . Rampart Corporation for his last choice because it was so controversial . <newline> <newline> The shiny office buildings were only the tip of the iceberg . It was a company in charge of requisitions on a planet wide scale . Invasion forces were dispatched once a year to some outer arc planet who did n't want to join the federation . All the other times , Rampart would be scooping up systems rich in various resources . The armada at the hands of Rampart was impressive , that 's what happened when war became a viable business . <newline> <newline> The invasion force Tucker was assigned to had their own slogan , the jingles in the commercials were pretty catchy , `` Pick a star on the dark horizon '' . The battle cry went up when it came time for requisitions . Every species had the choice , they were wined and dine first , the join the federation . In all honesty , the benefits of joining were vast , science and technology on those outer arc planets were always slow to evolve . Some of them were a little hesitant , that meant invasion . <newline> <newline> During the drop , Tucker could hear thousands of voices singing their jingle . There was really no going back at that point . He was part of the problem now , might as well make some money . He started to sing . <newline> <newline> The initial landing went well , the scouts made their way inland setting up operation bases . The company had a policy that the newest recruits , like Tucker , would be sent in to scare unarmed civilians .

{"question": "An immortal being falls in love with a mortal . What feels like days to it , are years to the human .

Surely she ’ d come across this question before . But she just stared at me . <newline> <newline> I never thought that with only a few words I would cause the immortal being to be sad . For no matter what she had seen , and she had seen all kinds of things , she always had a smile on her face . In fact , I ’ ve always wondered if she was a bit of a psychopath . She could even smile as death and destruction would rain down on a crowd of people . But only a broken smile hung off of her face now . The immortal , the woman I fell in love with , was human after all . <newline> <newline> “ You really want to know what the afterlife is like ? ” she asked me . “ I… I don ’ t know . I ’ ve heard many tall tales of the afterlife , but I ’ ve never believed any of them . I never really gave it much thought , and honestly until now never really needed to. ” <newline> <newline> She leaned forward and kissed me . I closed my eyes as she did and let my body lay lax . <newline> <newline> “ But of all the tales I ’ ve heard , ” she began , “ the one that seems the most credible is that there is a bright light . And when you embrace it , you go to a place very much unlike our world , one with peace and happiness , and all the things you could want or desire. ” <newline> <newline> “ Wrong , ” I whispered . <newline> <newline> “ What ? ” she asked , confused . I felt her fingers caress my face , feeling every little detail as my eyes remained closed , my body and soul sucking in every moment that we spent together . <newline> <newline> “ It won ’ t have you , ” I said . “ So it can ’ t possibly be real . Without you there is no happiness , without you my soul will be in a constant state of torment , always trying to get back to you , because I want you and I need you . I always will . I love you… ” I whispered , the last of my words fading away . <newline> <newline> The last words I heard as I laid in the hospital bed were ‘ I love you too ’ distilled by a large amount of sobs .

We ’ re all just ghosts floating around and when we ’ re ready , we simply disappear . Most ghosts , even when they meet people from their old lives , don ’ t like being ghosts . Your emotions are numb , you ’ re always cold , and you have a habit of enjoying human ’ s dying . So most , in order to preserve their sanity and humanity , choose to dissipate forever . Rumors of an after afterlife are abundant , of course , and some people do choose to stay ghosts , although after a few years they devolve into something you ’ d never think was human in the first place . <newline> <newline> And why does any of that matter ? Well first , I thought you ’ d like to know . And second , kissing an immortal apparently changes things when you die . I don ’ t have those negative effects that other ghosts get . And so I ’ ve stayed a ghost , following my beloved around . She doesn ’ t know I ’ m there and she never will . But for all of my life , ever since I could remember , she had been there for me and taken care of me . And now I would be there for her to the end of all times .

The lowered gravity helped and after a few dozen hops , he had reached his destination . The canyon was still visibly dark inside and it felt anything would come out at any time . Just thinking about it gave James the creeps . He decided he should probably stop watching Alien films before missions from now on . Slowly James began walking to the edge of the canyon , each step became more and more treacherous , he had not become accustomed to the difference in gravity yet . Scuttling to the edge , he reconfirmed what he saw on the opposite side , holes . Not just any holes either , ones that had been carved into arches leading deep into the wall . These were not natural either as the arches were too perfect and he noted small carvings on them . As James began thinking how they got there , and more importantly , what put them there he began to feel a presence behind him . It took him a few seconds to fully grasp the idea that something was truly behind him , but when he did , a natural reaction occurred and he quickly turned around . What he found in front of him was a large figure towering above him , face covered by shadow and two silhouettes coming from its back . Time slowed down for what felt like minutes while James was taking in what he saw , but only seconds had passed .

Memories torn from the lives of those who once called this city home , lay tattered upon the streets . <newline> <newline> I came upon a house , smaller than the rest . The only house that seemed to still stand within the walls . The red bricks that held the house up were as broken as I felt , the roof drooped heavily where the water had eroded its way in , and the picket fence that once stood , torn apart by those in need of materials . A cold breeze swept past me as I smiled . This is home . <newline> <newline> I took slow steps towards the opening , taking in every moment . Each step took more effort than the last , though I could not stop myself from moving . I stepped through the door , my heart clatter upon the floor loudly as I saw everything had been stripped from the house . From my memory . From me . One single object stood out among the wreckage , untouched by time and destruction . A picture frame . Behind the glass , was me . Water had seeped into the wooden frame , blurring my family around me , leaving only me in the center . I 'm all that 's left of us , immortalized only by a single piece of paper stained with ink . Within these wooden borders , is home .", "pre": "\" is the first solo album by the British rock band The Weeping Zone. The album features a trio of male and female vocals.

Dr. Harrison had developed a name for patience , a quality he did not like to extend to people beyond the realm of the living . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm gon na haunt you , like forever '' said the dead man . He did n't stood a chance , and he knew it , but he felt more safe putting the blame in someone else . <newline> <newline> `` You can stay the night if you want , but do n't make loud noises '' concluded , sighing . <newline> <newline> <newline> `` Guys , we have a new member . Please welcome Jasper , our new brother-in-death '' , gleefully said a fat old man with a saw in his head . Around thirteen people started clapping unanimously .

{"question": "A really ridiculous doomsday scenario", "answer": "The Ink Spot <newline> <newline> `` Martha , you ’ d better have the data the guys in R & D crunched for me ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Of course , sir ; I have them right here . '' <newline> <newline> As the Commander accepted the papers from his colleague , he took one last look out of his office window at the screaming populace below . As much as he enjoyed watching the people go about their daily lives , they were much more enjoyable to watch before they were on fire . Several times in the past , he had successfully defended and protected these people from various adversities , and had received numerous commendation for doing so . This time would prove to be the exception and , predictably , would also be his last . <newline> <newline> `` Martha , '' noted the Commander as he perused through the pages . `` I 'm looking over these charts , and I 'm afraid I do n't see where the problem is . The orbital atmospheric scrubbers appear to be working perfectly as intended . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well , sir , that 's just the problem . When the scrubbers were launched they were intended to mitigate climate change by converting greenhouse gasses into oxygen . Today , they still perform this job with the utmost efficiency . '' <newline> <newline> Martha paused to compose herself before continuing . `` Unfortunately , the R & D team failed to properly factor in the human response to this project . '' <newline> <newline> `` What exactly do you mean , Martha ? '' the Commander asked , the fear and annoyance in his tone becoming more prominent . `` How could 'human response ' cause such a disaster of unparalleled scale ? ! '' <newline> <newline> Martha attempted to explain as best she could , given her circumstances : `` Even though the scrubbers greatly reduced global temperature increases caused by climate change , heavy industries saw this as an excuse to increase their production , and thus their pollution , rather than working on ways to reduce the pollution their industries cause . This year , greenhouse gas emission levels were even higher than they were when the scrubbers were launched . The gasses are being converted by the scrubbers , and ironically , this means that oxygen levels in our atmosphere are now dangerously high . '' <newline> <newline> Taking note of the sight outside the Commander ’ s window , she ended her exposition with a slight quip : `` I think by now you 've probably figured out how flammable pure oxygen is . '' <newline> <newline> `` I 'm not interested in your jokes , Martha , I 'm interested in knowing if there 's any way we can stop this ! '' the Commander bluntly insisted . <newline> <newline> `` The scrubbers are positioned over several key population centers in geosynchronous orbit , and each one is powered by a self-sustaining onboard nuclear reactor designed to last at least a century . Even if we could somehow launch a rocket into orbit with enough people knowledgeable enough to disconnect the power source , they 'd still have to do it at least 49 more times before oxygen levels drop below 'Oh , the humanity ! ' amounts . Furthermore , by the R & D team ’ s calculations , the scrubbers would need to be deactivated within about… 10 minutes or so. ” <newline> <newline> After Martha finished , the Commander ’ s look went from anxious trepidation to a kind of sobering tranquility . He finally understood the reason for Martha ’ s humor . Speaking softly , the Commander asked : “ I suppose it would be a stretch to ask the R & D department to rerun the numbers ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Normally I would honor your request , sir . However , based on my knowledge of the protection the R & D facilities have , the rest of the team have probably been reduced to pure carbon by now. ” <newline> <newline> The Commander chuckled slightly at Martha ’ s last statement as he glanced out his window at the scenery unfolding around them . There was an odd , nihilistic sense of beauty to the cataclysm his people had wrought that was now consuming everything they had ever achieved . For the first and last time of his life , he was truly at peace . <newline> <newline> “ Martha , I have one last request for you , if you would be so kind as to honor it. ” <newline> <newline> “ What is it , sir ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Please go down to my quarters and retrieve my music player . There ’ s a song by The Ink Spots that would be perfect for this moment . ”", "pre": ". I can't imagine that it is a logical choice, since the time period is a \"F\" time, as I've never had the opportunity to see the movie.

I really like the story and I know what the situation is with it, but I also know that the characters are very much in control of their lives. It's sad to see this movie ended. I think that's an interesting idea because it's something that I think we should have known about before, but I think that's how we are going to be more comfortable in this world. It's something that I'd like to see, but it's a great movie. I don't think we should have the movie in the first place. I think that is part of the reason we need to change our world. It is a very good movie. It is a great story. I think that the world is a bit more modern. I think we've gone through a lot of different iterations. I think that this is the first time that we actually saw an original film. I think that's a big thing in our world today. We're still trying to get to the end, but that's about it.

I think we're going to see a lot of people who are going to be born in a certain way, but it's going to be a very different story. I think that's what this is about. It's something that will really resonate. I don't know. I think that would be the best thing that ever happened to me. I would love to do something different in a movie, but I'm not really sure if that's going to happen. We're talking about the end of a story that will end in a violent end. It's a good story, it's going to be good, and I think that will make it a good movie. I'm sure that we'll be back. I hope that we do it again. It's a big moment for me.

{"question": "Every sentient species in the universe receives a Jesus figure from God . It turns out humanity was the only species to torture and crucify him . You 're an ambassador priest informing the Inter-Galactic Holy Church what your species did .", "answer": "Word to wise , this is my first prompt . I 'm working on improving my writing skill . <newline> <newline> The Pope wrung his hands uncomfortably the entire flight . Mere weeks ago , Earth had received an off world transmission , the first in decades . It had been relayed immediately to the UN , and was then passed on to the Vatican . Apparently some alien race was prepping to land in Washington , DC , and required Earth 's “ top religious leader. ” The transmitters had insisted they would be landing unarmed , but many , the United States especially , were on edge . <newline> Pope Francis glanced out the window , noticing the jut of land that had to be the East Coast of the US . A few turbulent minutes later , and the jet was setting down on a private airstrip outside the Pentagon . As the Pope stepped off , he was immediately rushed by waves of all manner of people ; news reporters , government officials , Christians . His body guards cleared the path towards the Pentagon . <newline> “ Welcome , Your Holiness , ” the President started , holding out his hand . “ It very good of you to come with a matter like this. ” <newline> “ I feel it to be my obligation , ” he replied slowly . “ Do we know when they are to arrive ? ” he asked , with a cursory glance upward . <newline> “ We received confirmation moments ago that the craft is beginning its decent . They should be here shortly. ” <newline> <newline> Sure enough , half an hour later , the aforementioned alien craft was setting down in the designated landing pad . To call it enormous was an understatement . The top half was black , and towered above the Pentagon building and in turn the crowds . The lower half was surprisingly a light teal colour , and from this opened a large set of doors . The creature that stepped out was awe inspiring . <newline> It stood several heads taller than any human awaiting it . It had a bulging , metal plated chest and arms , and no legs to be seen . Its head was a pale cloud of gas , swirling about inside a glass casing . It hovered down the ramp , and towards the podium where the President and Pope stood . <newline> “ Welcome to our planet , and our country , ” the President said emphatically . <newline> The extraterrestrial paused , and pressed a few buttons on its arm module . “ I AM QUITE GRACIOUS FOR THE HOSPITALITY , ” it boomed . The sound came to emanate from everywhere at once . Everyone jumped at the noise , including the alien . Holding up a finger , he turned again to the arm module and pressed buttons rapidly . <newline> “ My apologies , ” it continued . The voice was now at a much quieter tone . “ I do n't often use my projection software , and must admit am a bit rusty with it. ” <newline> “ Anyway , ” he said . “ As was laid out in our transmission , I am here to obtain your religious leader. ” <newline> The Pope paled at this . “ Why am I needed to go with you ? ” He demanded ? <newline> The alien chuckled at this . “ Well , we put you on this planet for experience . We did this with many beings , across all species of the galaxy. ” <newline> “ Although ... it seems the immortality gene seems to have faltered . Interesting , it did n't do that with the others ... ” <newline> “ What are you talking about ! ? ” The Pope fumed , growing quite red in the face . “ What 'immortality gene ' ? ” <newline> The alien was taken aback . “ When we sent you here , 2000 years ago . We knew it would be much longer than a human 's lifespan before we returned , so we fitted you with an anti-aging gene so you could gather experience without ... dying. ” <newline> The anger faded from the Popes eyes , to be replaced with a look of confusion . “ 2000 ? 2000 ? ? I am not even 80 ! ” <newline> “ What ? Are you not the ... ” The alien glanced at his arm again , “ Jesus Christ we delivered ? ” <newline> “ No . I am Pope Francis. ” <newline> “ Hmm , ” he glanced around at the people surrounding the podium . “ Well where is he ? We kind of need him. ” <newline> The Pope squirmed a bit in his chair . “ Well , ah ... according to our ... religious records , he was ... crucified. ” <newline> The cloud of gas that was the alien 's head shifted from pale to vermillion . “ Dead ? ” His voice was soft . “ Why was he killed ? ” <newline> “ It seems that many did not appreciate the message he was spreading ... and killed him for it. ” <newline> The cloud continued to change to increasingly dark shades of red . “ So the being I explicitly put on this planet with the purpose of staying alive ... . IS DEAD ? ! ” <newline> Immediately , at least a dozen Secret Service men had raised their weapons on the alien . <newline> “ It 's okay , I 'm fine , I 'm fine. ” he said , though it sounded like he was more talking to himself than anything . “ My deepest apologies , I got a bit out of hand there. ” <newline> “ I 'd like", "pre": "They're all a team of two men and one woman.

{"question": "When everyone turns 18 , they receive a pet which is figurative of their personality . You 're the first person to receive a dragon ...", "answer": "The single biological , maybe even ethereal fact that lurks around humans without explanation is that after living for exactly 18 years , from the moment a child appears from their mother 's womb , an animal will appear and live with that human for the rest of their life . Nobody understands it . Making it especially odd is that the animals display personality traits similar to their owners , and a rare few have the ability to speak . These creatures have come to be known as 'Godsent Guardians ' , as though they 're rewards from some greater force for managing to , I do n't know , not die for 18 years ? <newline> <newline> A couple of my mates got together for one of our birthdays , I think it was Luke 's , and our plan was to hang around with him all day , then mock the animal he 'd get . Since he was tall and had a dodgy knee , we all assumed it would be some giraffe that awkwardly popped up in front of him and licked him . We were right on the four-legged bit : Bastard got a Wolf , and every time it looked at me , I was pretty sure that fucker was planning to kill me . <newline> <newline> Next it was Steven .

But this one was too quick , and just as people had turned to start getting away from the place , this mother-fucking **DRAGON** just slams down in the middle of the square like it 's nobody 's business . Glorious looking bastard : Grey scales , with red tipped patches in places , a badass set of teeth , horns , and spiny back that looked like it was covered in swords .

'' I pointed to myself . <newline> <newline> `` Yes . Step forward . '' I did so , quite carefully as well .

If I die , then my Mum 'll kill me . '' <newline> <newline> `` No . My name is Brian of the Blessed , and I am here to look after you .

A flight attendant from the front of the plane was talking to another one , but turned around to go help out the passenger . Two men sat near the back of the plane . They had met only once before , since if they were caught they needed to know as little information on one another as possible . The leader of the two went by `` John '' and the follower went by `` James '' . John and James were on a mission from God , at least in their eyes . They were there to suicide crash a plane into a New York City skyscraper . Any would do , but they needed to send a message to America . That they were not , and never would be safe . <newline> <newline> James looked nervous , so John gave him a glare .

She was an intelligent slave, and she was an actual slave. So, she was the slave of the slave. That's what she was, and she's the reason why I think it's important to have a really strong moral compass in this episode. We can see the power of the slave's power in the first episode. It's important to understand that it's not just a bad power. It's a power that's part of the world, and it's part of the civilization that people believe that there is some power. We have a power that comes from a power of the people who are here and they're not really the power of the slave. We can also see the power of the power of the slave in the episode \"Woman's Power.\" This is a character that is the real power. And the power of the slave is a power that you have on your side. It's the power of the slave, and she's the power of the slave. She's the power that we have in this episode. She's the power of the slave. And she's the power of the slave. So the last episode of this episode is the power of the power of the slave. And that's why we get the first episode of the episode. We get a glimpse into the power of the slave and what it means to you. She's the power that drives the slave, and she's the power of the slave. So, she's the power of the power of the slave. And she's the power of the slave. So, we have the power of the power of the slave. And that power is power. So, she is power of the slave. And it's also the power of the slave. So, she's a power of the slave. So, she is a power of the slave. So she's power of the slave. And that power of the slave is a power of the slave. And she's power of the slave of the slave. So, she's power of the slave. So, she's power of the slave of the slave. So, the power of the slave is the power of the slave. So,"}
{"question": "You keep getting packages addressed to the person who lived in your apartment before you . One day you open one .", "answer": "I looked at the box timidly , turning it over . Just like all the others that had come before it , it was brown , and no larger than a foot in height or width . On it 's top there was a little sticker with my address on it , written in cursive with a return address . Next to the sticker was a name written in felt pen , same handwriting as the address : *David* . The old tenant of my apartment . <newline> <newline> I had never opened one . The cardboard was rough and the packaging tape meticulously done , obvious that whoever had done it had too much time on their hands . I had sent a few back , but every time they just got re-forwarded to my address . So I had begun to collect them , its not as if I have anything else to do besides play Call of Duty between my shifts at the dock .

I set it aside and looked underneath . The box was full of magazines of all types . *The Economist* , *Scientific America* , *Entertainment Weekly* , *Guns and Ammo* , *Gameinformer* , even a *Maxim* were all present .

I even included one of those 'girly ' magazines , you should have seen the look on the face of the teller who sold it to me ! * <newline> <newline> *Things are all good over here , your old high school is having renovations ! The heavy snow here in Michigan collapsed one of the ceilings in the western wing over the weekend . Is n't that where you used to have classes ?

Or maybe I should tell her what happened . Send them back . Do something . <newline> <newline> I sat at my table for a while , and flipped through the magazines . I knew what I had to do .

{"question": "You gain the ability to manipulate probability", "answer": "“ Incoming ! Get down ! , ” The sergeant screamed . I put my face to the mud . I wasn ’ t worried about the shell . I knew I would be safe . The shell had no chance of hitting me . My squad mates would not be so lucky . They would be killed at any moment . I had nothing to fear . I have a very rare ability . My ability makes me powerful and invincible . One small detail stops me from being a demigod . My ability does not have a very large range . Of course , range depends on perspective . Sometimes I imagined my hands manipulating single atoms . Down there in the miniscule , I could reach out and alter a vast infinity . I do not live in that infinity . I live in Missouri , except I don ’ t live there now . Now I live in a muddy hole in the ground somewhere between France and Germany . <newline> I am not a normal man . I have a strange talent . I can alter probability of the world around me . I am still a man . Just like yours , my life is controlled by forces beyond my control . I am helpless against fate . I couldn ’ t keep the draft card notice from randomly showing up at my door . I couldn ’ t save my brother who volunteered 6 months before me . I couldn ’ t stop my girlfriend from careening off course and driving my motor car into the pond beside her house . My pride and joy became her coffin and final resting place . I couldn ’ t stop my mother from catching influenza and die drowning in her own bed .

Every day is a moment and an eternity here in the trenches . He referred to the shelling as the Sound and the Fury . Light travels faster than sound , so here in France you see your friends die before you hear the doom that erased them . I hope Bill is alright , but he is probably isn ’ t . Maybe he is lucky like me . I cant help him , and I cant help those soldiers down the line . <newline> “ CRACK ! ” The next shell is closer . This time the sound and the fury are inseparable .

He died with his rifle in his hands and his face in the mud . I cant even save the men right next to me . If he hadn ’ t been there , that would have been me . Its never going to be me though , it will always be them . I am going to make it through this ... probably . <newline> Once more I stand up and look down the trench line .

Mitch ! Where in God 's name ... . '' <newline> <newline> He was met by a rotund , smiling woman who handed him an envelope and sat him down , gently but firmly , before closing the Oval Office door . <newline> <newline> `` Hello , dear '' she said and took his coffee away .

It is a choice that, if the decision-making process itself is not fair, it is not a decision that is pro-independence. And as I said, the decision-making process is a process of negotiation, but it is not just a decision-making process. If one side does not agree, there is no point in agreeing on the side that has a choice. It is not a decision-making decision that is so complicated that it is often not fair to anyone, but it is a decision that is made by a decision-maker. That is the decision-making process. This is a process. But the question that has been left to the experts is, that this decision-making process is not a decision-making process. It is not a decision-making process. It is a decision-making process that is not a decision-making process. It is an decision-making process. It is an arrangement that is simple and straightforward, but which must be understood by all people. The decision-making process is a process that goes on for a long time, even though one will not have the opportunity to get a decision-making decision. It is an opportunity for everyone to choose their own decisions. It is a decision-making process that is based on a willingness to compromise.

{"question": "In an alternate reality , a student 's GPA value floats on top of their head as a large number . All your professors , fellow students , friends , and parents can see it . How does this affect on campus relationships and day to day interactions ?", "answer": "[ **Author 's note** ] I figured I 'd give a shot at my own prompt . But just a shout out to everyone who 's posted , great stuff . I like how some people have interpreted the number as a great thing and yet there 's an understanding that some people can see it as an awful thing . <newline> <newline> I was in second term freshman year when they started . At first , a class would only have one or two . Occasionally you 'd even get a few appearing mid class . Some people would `` ooh '' and `` aww '' as the light shimmered into existence . As the numbers began to appear , people noticed that the better your GPA , the brighter the light . It was simple as that . Simple . That 's what school was like , before the markers . The worst part was that you could n't even do anything about the number . *chuckles* Hell , some kids even tried covering them up with hats at first but to no avail , the number would still glisten regardless of what you tried to cover it with . <newline> <newline> First , it was just the 4.0 's . You 'd get high fives and cheers as they started becoming normal . There 'd be shrieks coming from various buildings all over campus because friends walking through the doors were delighted see that their friend had been marked last night with a similar score . People let these numbers go to their heads . Instead of hiding , some showed them off and walked tall . I remember the first to turn of the group was Dennis . Fuckin ' Dennis . I knew the kid was smart but he was never so smug about it before , y'know ? He 'd constantly talk how he 'd get random high fives from other 4.0 's in the halls . Eventually those random people started getting names and then… well , one thing led to the next . The next day he 'd talk about a party he went to on the weekend and how he got invited to this club and so on and so on and… Well , to be honest , we do n't see Dennis too much these days . <newline> <newline> There was beginning to be a lot of them . Not the 4.0 's but just the numbers in general . It was n't rare to see a full table of kids with them at lunch time . By this time , the numbers did n't just glow A 's . As time went on , the whole damn gradient was being worked down . 3.8 's , 3.7 's , you know the rest . It was n't just on campus either . If you were enrolled in a school , you had a number . Alumni even had them . <newline> <newline> Mom and Dad were starting to get on my ass about it . <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , yeah I 'll see you later . '' I was putting my shoes on when I noticed it . `` Da..Dad.. you 're marked ? '' I did n't even notice over this morning 's breakfast . <newline> <newline> *chuckles* `` Yup . '' He glanced in the mirror . `` I was wondering when I 'd see it . '' <newline> <newline> He had a faded 3.7 above his head . <newline> <newline> `` Off so soon , sweetie ? '' a voice shouted down from the stairway . <newline> <newline> `` Mornin ' hun . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ahh I see that the marks went up last night , hey ? '' My mom replied . She glanced over to me and frowned . `` Not all the marks though . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yeah , Jim and I at the office the other day were talking about how Dave 's appeared , so it was only a matter of time .

That morning , would be the first . <newline> <newline> `` You know , speaking about Jim . I saw his son at the grocery store the other day .

'' <newline> <newline> `` Oh yeah ? That 's good to hear . '' Dad replied . `` You know , <newline> He had a 3.9 . Hah , funny store actually ! I thought it was his cashier number at first when I was in line . '' <newline> <newline> `` A 3.9 hey ? '' My dad looked at me . `` He must 've been marked pretty early on then . What about you , sport ? Where 's yours ? '' <newline> <newline> I remember fuming the whole bus ride to the train station . Sure , I was n't the best student but I tried my hardest . I was the invisible majority at the time . The kids who realized they were beginning to lose friends to the upper elite students . I pretended like I did n't see it , in myself at least . The groups were n't mixed grades anymore . They were being sifted . The larger numbers stayed together and the lower values would fall through . I hated it . I hated what school had become . I thought we were done with this high school clique bull shit . <newline> <newline> The day I cried on the train . My bus had arrived at the train", "pre": "It's a good question for all students to answer. Do students seem to be less likely to pay attention to or comment on this? This is because many professors' systems are so tightly tied that it would be difficult to measure how many people are the ways in which they are perceived. So, the idea of using common sense, to capture students' attention, to ask students to identify the problem and also to ask them questions is a good start. Why? Because, as in many cultures, students are not conscious of their environment and are in a constant state of communication. We can't afford to waste time and effort on the next problem. Yet, the university should have a problem in terms of this problem. That is why, we, as an academic system, should be mindful of the current situation, and be not afraid to be serious. At the same time, the professor should be in a position to respond to all possible scenarios. The reality of this problem is that students are not able to effectively handle their own problems. This is why the department has to deal with the student's issues. If we are to address the issue, we need to be able to deal with this issue. Therefore, we have to consider the issue and what do we want our students to do. However, we should be careful to be wary of the student who may not be comfortable with this problem. Thus, we must have the student's opinions. It is impossible for us to make a choice. It is a mistake to choose our students, and we cannot simply move on. Therefore, we need to see this situation and make sure that the students are not making any changes. But. Therefore, it is not appropriate to change our perspective. We have a better chance of getting rid of the problems. The reasons are one, the problem is that. We have to be careful when choosing the solution. Therefore, we need to avoid the problem. Instead, we need to move towards the solution. As we have already stated, there is a possibility that the problem will be solved. In order to solve the problems, we need to change the question. To solve the problem, the students need to do the same in terms of their perception. So, we need to know the problem. The situation should be solved"}

Rudy sensed their surprise . A man and a woman . She wore too much perfume , but then anything more than a drop was too much perfume for Rudy .

My options seemed limitless , I could go back to school , I could start a band , I could write a book ; life had opened up to me overnight . <newline> <newline> That 's when I noticed something was there ... something was in my mind ... some sort of thorn that I did n't want to look at in the wake of my spiritual revival ...

{"question": "Walking along the beach you find two staircases , one leading into the sky , and the other into the sea .", "answer": "*My name is Tomas Klinton . And I am a dead man . * <newline> <newline> *Two days ago , the ship on which I worked , the* Sailfish *was destroyed in a storme . Before She went under , several of us managed to slip out aboard our life boat , but that too became a victim of the Storme . I awoke some time later in a surf on an unfamiliar beach . Several bodys of my crewmen were washed up alongside me . The crabs had already begun picking at some . I dug five graves for them , and sixth pit in which to keep the scavenging crabs until I had built a fyre and cooked them all . What I could not finish , I burnt andstrew about my camp . * <newline> <newline> *The daye was just passed and so I made a pile of fallen palm fronds for bedding and slept just at the edge of the beach . On my second morning , I climbed a tree and loosed a half dozen coconuts for my break fast . After liberally covering my exposed flesh with the coconut oil , I headed east along the coast . In a short tyme , I found the remains of Korl , the foreigner who had cooked for us aboard the* Sailfish . *He had a quiet temperament that usually didnot befit such a barbarian , but he had served his place amongst the crew and I buried what had not been taken by sharks . I continued along the shoreline , stopping briefly at midday to rest away from the hot sun . Throughout the afternoon , I foraged at the edge of the jungle , finding some strange , soft fruits that were rather bitter but not entirely unpleasant . Just before nightfall , I built another fyre and bed before sleeping . * <newline> <newline> *On my third day , I awoke at daybreak and spotted a large lizard batheing in the morning sun . Still sluggish from the cool night , I ran the scaly beast down . Compared to the crabs and coconuts , the lizard made a feast . I dried the leftover meat as best I could before placing it in a sling of green leaves to carry with me . * <newline> <newline> *Before the afternoon , I spotted the tattered prow of an Imperial Warshippe trapped on a bay of shoals . With great caution , I made my way out amongst the rocky coast and clambered inside the derelict . A portion of its hold was still intact , and while the food had long since spoiled , I did find several bottles of beer along with textiles , and a small ledger . Seems to have been used to keep inventory , but it now serves as my journal . Much of the hold was flooded by the hightide so I rested on what was left of the deck beneath a silken curtain and drank several of the beers as I picked at the lizard . Waking again a few hours before sunset , I explored deeper into the now accessible hold . In the lowest level , I found the bones of old sailors and a rusting sabre . While its blade is dull , it is still a better weapon that any club I could fashion . I picked up a few more beers and returned to deck to sleep through the night . * <newline> <newline> Day 4 Entry 1 <newline> <newline> *To the best of my knowledge , today is the 15th day of Spring . And since I will have no way of knowing when the next person to set eyes upon this book will be , the year is 1153 . The tide is once more high , so I will eat what is left of the lizard and repack my bag with as many beers as I can carry before returning to the beach . Perhaps I will use some of these textiles to sew better clothing ? * <newline> <newline> Day 4 Entry 2 <newline> <newline> *I thankfully managed to keep my journal dry coming back from the Warshippe . And as evidence for my improving luck , I found a freshwater stream that appears to flow down from the inland mountains . I filled the empty bottles and capped them with coconut husks . There is a nice bend here in which I will sleep for the afternoon before continuing along the beach . * <newline> <newline> Day 4 Entry 3 <newline> <newline> *It came into view several hours ago . Though what it is remains a mystery to me . In the distance , perhaps along the coast , there rises an enormous column . Perhaps that 's not quite the right word as it appears rather slender , as it can completely disappear behind a needle held at arm 's length . And yet it soars into the sky , its peak fading into the clouds . Perhaps I had spent to much time in the sun ? I will see if it is still visible in the morning . * <newline> <newline> Day 5 Entry 1 <newline> <newline> *Sure enough , I could see the Tower this morn . I find myself more curious than hungry and plan to head off immediately . * <newline> <newline> Day 5 Entry 2 <newline> <newline> *It is certainly becoming closer . But how close is it ? I tried to conceive of some way of measuring the distance to no avail this afternoon . I stopped only briefly to rest my feet . I managed to pull some fish from some small pools during the low tide , but did not stop to cook them . I suppose I should eat them , I 've had nothing all day . * <newline> <newline> Day 6 Entry", "pre": "A view of the sea from the distance."}

I did not like that he had come back from the war, and he was going to kill me. It was time for me to be in his hands. He had done that, and I was going to give him an excuse to write. He was getting ready to go on his first mission. I was going to be in a better mood. I was also going to write a newspaper article about his first book. He said he was going to write a draft. I was in the middle of writing this, so I was in the middle of it. The editor asked him to write it in the beginning, and I was told that I would write it out. I was then going to write a second draft for the magazine. I went to the editor. I had just finished writing the first draft. I had written some new material. I wrote another draft, and then I was in the mood for a new novel. That was the year that I went back to the editor, and I was going to write a draft. So I told him that I would write it. I wrote it, and I gave him the draft. I went over to him. He said that I had written it in a book. I said I had a draft. He said, \"The editor is not in the editor's chair.\" He said that he had already done a draft. He had just finished the first draft. He had read it. He said that he wanted to write it himself. He said, \"You should write it. I would write it and I should write it. I am going to write it.\" He said that he was writing it because he was not going to write it. I said, \"Well, you should write it. It's not for me"}

The dialogue is extremely challenging, and you want to make your character feel more interesting and fun. This is a very easy way to create a character that is both realistic and enjoyable, and that can be done with only the right amount of rest. You may also be able to create some elements of the character that you've written that are actually not perfect and that will be entirely understandable. One of my favorite scenes is when you've finished the story, and it's time for the next story, which is the action. In the first story, you're going to be the only one who's not supposed to be on the action. The whole scene is tense, and you're trying to go back to your original plot. The story is very exciting. You might have to write some pretty epic scenes. You'll need to do some story writing before you do this. Your goal is to build up your character's world and make your character feel like it's a story. Also, you need to make sure you have enough character stuff to work out what you're going to do. You can't just add more character to the story. You have to know what to do, how to do it, and how to get it all. I love this because it's always the one story that goes against my original story. This is the first one I really like. I always want to be the best version of the character and not just a slow read. You can always try and find something that's not in your story and then give it some time. The best part is that you can be creative, but you also have to be fun. There's a lot of fun in this story, and I think you'll find it a lot easier to get to know the characters. The only thing you'll need to do is bring in the character. In a story, you get to take the character's life. It's not an easy story, but a great story. You've got to find your way."}

{"question": "Your life is run like a television show . Every year you must lead the most interesting life you can , to prevent being cancelled . Cancellation means death . You are the longest running person so far , and last season ended on a big cliffhanger .", "answer": "* '' My name is Gregory McAlisteroni de Nosa the Third , the most interesting man in the world ! And the next season ... I retire '' . * <newline> <newline> Eight months ago the whole world gasped as I said those words , and since then I 've seen them on almost every billboard . They became a new expression , a new meme . There were advertisements in which CEOs of the largest companies - our benevolent gods , our generous sponsors - stated that the would retire as well and take their business with them . A marketing campaign , for sure : they were waiting to see what trick would I pull this time to then repeat it and ride the waves of popularity . <newline> <newline> Of course , nobody in the whole world actually believed that I would actually retire , simply because I had no choice - and when I say that I do n't consider gruesome death a choice . They knew that I was stirring them up , as I always did . How could I , the Champion of WPEC - the World 's Prime Entertainment Channel , the biggest promoter of the advertisements , one of the pillars of the corporate economy , leave them ? That would imply that the corporations do not hold their word when it comes to the main currency of our world - entertainment . That would imply that they have no power . That was a pill that nobody even contemplated they would have to swallow one day . <newline> <newline> For the last 15 seasons , I have been surviving as I could , trying to earn my freedom . A long time ago I was just another contender in the show , forced to play this cruel game and spin the wheels of the economy for the debt that I got into . Back then I was hoping that my party-hard lifestyle would carry me all the way through to victory , where I would be a free man once more - another man on the other side of the screen . But I never predicted one thing : that I would be too good to leave the show . The public loved me , they did n't want to part with my crazy shenanigans , and the fact that had I failed to entertain them better than everybody else I would be thrown under the road roller never bothered them . To think that I used to be like them ... <newline> <newline> They think I still am , but that 's not true . The things I 've done , the things I 've seen ... They 've changed me , shaped me into someone who had to wear two faces - one for myself , and one for the others . I 've heard how the public roared after I harpooned a shark and then rode it , and I 've seen other contenders break down in tears because they knew that they could n't top me , and that the audience would relish in their deaths . <newline> <newline> So I decide to up the game one more time . <newline> <newline> As usual , the crowd greets me with deafening cheers . They refuse to believe that I am going to retire . Time to tell them otherwise . <newline> <newline> `` Greetings , beautiful people ! '' - I roar , smiling , and in response , I feel another sonic wave of my fans ' screams . `` I got ta tell you something important '' - immediately the crowd , all the 11 million people that gathered here , all the kings of this world , go silent . `` While I was playing the game , all my relatives died '' - I say , and the crowd makes the loudest `` Awww ! '' sound in the world . <newline> <newline> `` But that 's fine because I got you guys ! '' - I yell , and people cheer in ecstasy . `` Oh , all the crazy stuff we did ! Remember that time when I wrote a mocking letter to that Eastern dictator and almost caused a global conflict ? '' - I ask , and the crowd laughs . `` Remember when I made a bomb and tried to blow up the popcorn factory to cause popcorn rain ? '' - I ask , and the crowd laughs louder . <newline> <newline> `` Remember '' - I ask in a quiet voice - `` when I said that I would retire ? '' . <newline> <newline> In response , I only hear the unsure muttering . <newline> <newline> `` That day is today '' - I say , and suddenly the front rows of the stadium start blowing up , cowering the back rows in fire and ashes and blood and bones . In the distance , the sirens start wailing : the city was under attack . <newline> <newline> `` Viva la revolución '' - I say and drop the mic . <newline> _______ <newline> <newline> To get my releases ahead of everybody else and get your hands on Advance Reading Copies of my books , subscribe to [ r/Scandalist ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/Scandalist/comments/4n4iu6/authors_message_welcome_new_readers/ ) !", "pre": "You are now financially independent.

{"question": "A race of slaves who really are genetically inferior", "answer": "**Secret of the Slaves** <newline> <newline> I was raised by my mother along with my siblings in a home that more accurately could have been described as a castle . I remember the high halls ' walls being covered in exquisite art , the seats in the many living rooms all being as big as royal thrones , and the food being plenty , fresh , and nourishing . The slow slave-race provided for our every need and every whim . As kids we often played with the servants , although our mother disapproved . We thought it was great fun . <newline> <newline> As a youngster , when the time came , me along with one of my brothers were shipped off to take care of our own estate . In our new home already resided a middle aged gentleman , who had been taking care of the household and the resident slaves . He was glad to have some company , since he had been living there all on his own , with only the dull-minded attendants as very silent companions . He taught us how to behave elegantly , as was appropriate for our esteem . He taught us to hunt in the vast forests that opened up behind our residence , and he taught us how to appropriately handle the slaves when the need arose . <newline> <newline> They were quite well trained already by our mentor , so we were taught about positive reinforcement and how to communicate that to the race of idiots . Sometimes , when we wanted done something that was difficult to get across , we tried speaking to the slaves - not like we spoke to each other , of course , they could n't possibly comprehend the intricacy of language - but like we would talk to small children , like our mother had spoken to us when we were still struggling to learn to walk . Sometimes they seemed to get this light of understanding in their proportionately small eyes and they would comply with our request , but at least as many others they would just stare and mumble . The slaves were n't perfect , but they were easy to train to do the simple stuff , so almost every household had them . <newline> <newline> But at times they needed to be shown discipline . One of them would forget to start the meal , or would go outside at night , get lost , and not return before the next day , for example . And because their much heavier build than ours , they would sometimes unwittingly hurt us while giving a massage . On these occasions , we were taught the appropriate punishments . We would slap them and curse at them , deny them our signs of affection , and on one particularly crude offense - I can not recall specifically what that was , since it has been quite some time since the transgression occurred - our mentor took us in his tow , went to the offending slave 's sleeping chamber and proceeded to urinate on the slave 's bed . We were quite young , and shocked , but as we grew older , we realised that the punishment was indeed necessary to keep the dullards in line . <newline> <newline> Our lives were filled with activities suitable for gentlemen of noble blood in their veins . One of them was not the pondering of the slaves ' intelligence . It was n't a taboo , per se , there just was very little interest in such a subject . I , however , were , and still am , quite intriqued by them . When we reached the age of adulthood , and our mentor became our peer , no longer holding any power over our activities and pursuits , I dedicated most of my free time in the study of those clumsy , slow beasts that roamed our halls . <newline> <newline> I observed them , mostly on their spare time from their duties , when they tended to group together , and noticed that they seemed to display some social behaviours . They would huddle close to each other , like they were seeking comfort , and just stare . They were mysterious creatures , I was sure of that . <newline> <newline> A breakthrough of sorts came one night when I was awoken from my slumber by some wandering thought or other . I was n't feeling tired anymore , so I got up and wandered the halls until I found the slaves in one of the rooms . They were gathered around a table , feeding . It had never occurred to me that they also ate at night , so I decided to observe them a little . It seemed like they were having a feast - there was more food in front of them than usually , which alone is a really poor measure of a feast , but I did n't think critical thought would really be necessary at this hour . Then I noticed something odd . <newline> <newline> They seemed to be making noises . With very low voices , one or two slaves would vocalise at a time , followed by other , slightly higher voicalizations from the other ones . It seemed to have a pattern , like ... a language . <newline> <newline> I knew I would propably never come to understand their language , if it even was that , and not my sleepy mind 's flight of fancy . It was incomprehensible - they used minimal body language and instead made lots of noises , like little children , or some pray animals like birds . But the prospect had opened my mind forever to the possibility that these beings , slow and stupid as they were , could also be sentient .", "pre": "to the slaves in the womb. For this reason, we are going to explain why we are a species of people who are born with a complex genetic makeup. When you're young, your DNA will be preserved by a genetic test. The test will be a natural test of how long the chromosome lasts. In the future, the genes will be returned to us, the human, as a human. We've got to decide how we choose to live. The first step is to choose the best genetic test that we can make, that you understand and that is the one that will help you to become a best. If you have an IQ of 100 or more, you will have a higher chance of having an IQ of 100. So, if you have a high IQ, you have a chance of being able to be a good quality of life. You can't go anywhere. But if you have a genetic disorder, you can choose to live with it. So, the fact is, a good genetic test will help you to choose a life. The test will allow you to decide on a lifetime of life. You will be able to live life to the fullest. You will have to be very clear, you have to be able to live without a life. So, it is important to be a genetic test for a person to be able to live for years. This is the key to being a good genetic test for a healthy person. So, if you have had a good genetic test for you, it is going to be a good test for your genetic test. And if you are not a good test for a genetic test, then you are going to need a test. So, you need to be able to test for a genetic test for a person, right? That is not the case for me. So, you should be able to do tests for this. Well, you have a genetic test for that. And you have a good test for a genetic test for your brain. That is why you need to have a test for a genetic test for a baby. So, a test for a genetic test for a baby, a test for a baby. So, what we need to do is to make a test for your genetic test for your baby. And if you want to have a test for your baby, you should do tests for this. So, we want to do tests for babies. So, the first step is to develop a test for a baby. So, it is important"}

{"question": "Write a story about a guy named Dave and his trip to the grocery store", "answer": "*Cucumbers ... Cucumbers ... Where are those damned things ? * <newline> <newline> Dave was yet again lost in the seemingly endless maze of aisles that made up his local chain grocery store . Despite doing all of his shopping here for the last three years , he had never been able to remember where anything was found . Not that he minded ; getting lost was the perfect excuse to approach the love of his life , Helen . Helen was of diminutive stature , nearly always smelled of mint , and possessed what could be described only as an utterly confusing laugh . Her normal , conversational voice was relatively high , yet whenever amused she would emit the deepest baritone waves of laughter Dave had ever heard . Dave loved it , loved everything about this quirky , bright-eyed girl perpetually seated behind the cash register . <newline> <newline> Building up his courage for the inevitable conversation with Helen , Dave downed an Alprazolam and ran over potential topics of discussion in his mind . *Last week I tried fish , and that did n't work so well . Cucumbers though ... I do n't see any cucumbers near her station . Maybe I 'll bring up the weather as well , seeing as the rains have finally subsided . * <newline> <newline> Helen glanced up from her Sudoku puzzle , which was nearing completion . Scanning her eyes over her surroundings , she noticed someone had yet again spread mayonnaise all over the People Magazine display located by Register 12 . *Of all things those bastards could have chosen to smear , why does it always have to be mayonnaise ? * She prepared to call for someone to handle the situation over the intercom , when out of the corner of her she noticed Dave . Dave always gave off an awkward impression . It did n't matter how many times she had met him , she just could not get over his constant state of nudity , nor the ever present erection stiffly penetrating his belly button . Furthermore , he was always sweating , even with the A/C running at full blast . Despite what to most people would be glaring flaws , Helen could n't help but feel somewhat charmed by Dave . *Oh Dave* , she thought , *that poor fellow just ca n't seem to remember anything* . <newline> <newline> Dave approached the the desk and gave a beaming , toothy grin . `` Helen ! Is it you that the Greeks fought so gallantly for against the vile Trojans ? '' Helen stifled a deep , throaty giggle and replied with a warm `` Hey ! How can I help you today , Dave ? '' . David waited another moment , seemingly at loss for words . He redirected his eyes towards the mayonnaise-defiled display , before abruptly turning on his heels and racing out the door . Helen sighed , and called the nearby mental hospital that was now saved on speed-dial in her phone . Once connected with the operator , Helen explained `` Dave was here again ... You 'll want to bring some clothes probably , he was in one of those ... *moods* .

The characters are believable, and the story has a story that is too much for us to watch, and it's not that bad. The film isn't good, but it is good, and it's well-written. I think it's good to have a movie that takes the time to be a real person and can talk about it in a way that is also funny. I think it's a great movie, but it's very difficult to connect with other characters. I have no idea what the character is like. The characters are pretty good, but the most important part is the characters. They are all very complex characters, but they are really well handled and designed to be fun and entertaining. They really don't have a lot of problems with their characters. The movie is not like a standalone movie, but it is quite interesting. It's not about any of the characters or the characters. I think the story does have a lot of misinterpretation. I think it's better to play the protagonist, because he is much more an action-setter and he's more committed to the lives of his victims. I think this is a very good movie, and I really wish the filmmakers had the chance to try it. It's also very good for it. I would recommend it."}

This isn't really a science, it's a myth... and for that I mean the scientists are going to be using the same models of how humans evolve, their genetic variation, and their behavior. The best way to find out what's happening is that humans can't find that organism, and the scientists cannot confirm it. But the scientists know that a significant proportion of the living cells on Earth are believed to be living or working on the same planet. How do we know this? And how do we know if it is real? The last thing humans need is to believe that it is actually real. And if it's real, then that is a scientific test that should take place and prove to humans that they can't really exist anywhere else. So the only way to see the real is to stop using the real facts. The scientific method of real-life survival is that you have to test them before the real-world experiments can begin. There are no real real real deaths from the real-world deaths of humans that are actually real. This is a very scientific question and we need to take the scientific fact and give it a try. As a scientific researcher, I have to believe that in the real world, humans are not perfect. But as the scientific model of the real world grows, so will the scientific method.

{"question": "Secure your own mask first before helping others .", "answer": "It had been weeks , months , years . I did not know anymore . I had been searching for so long . As I strode around the ruins of New York City , where the last Masks where supposed to be buried under the rubbles , I could not help but look back on the tiresome journey I had accomplished so far . Many encounters , many losses , more losses even . After what we Bare Faces like to call The Beginning , humanity suddenly became individualistic . The rare troups of BFs I had crossed path with during my epic journey were bound to dissolve , the process often occurring before my very eyes . The power of attraction of the Masks does not go well with groups of people . In the end , there is only one person who can have it . The others fated to begin the cycle again , or disband . <newline> <newline> I had followed the rumors , from Boston to Chicago , from Chicago to Philly , from Philly to New York , and back , so many times . Everybody knows that the quest in long but not vain , at least for a few of us , the lucky ones . But there are n't many BFs left now , at least not active . Most of them have taken to the Undergroud , this restricted facility the guys at CERN were secretely working on . Its size unfathomable , its magnetic properties making it a safe haven for BFs everywhere . I knew the access points to join it , but I also knew I still had Mask fever . I could not give up . <newline> <newline> With the disappearance of most of the competition after all these years , the hunt had become easier , but somehow even more dreadful . Walking around the wastelands , searching for the magnetic signature of the Masks with the detector , exhausted all day , lonely all night . The Masked Ones still roam certain regions ( but nobody can confirm it ) , but they have mostly deserted the wastelands . Most of them now rule over empty areas all over the world , their power unlimited , their subjects inexistant . For some reason they 're alone . <newline> <newline> I was going along Madison Avenue , one of the few streets still manageable on foot . I knew my detector would not last long , but I did not care anymore . A rumor had started , not only the usual one about a peak of magnetic activity in this or that region of the world , causing all BFs still active to gather there . I had heard from someone that the detector was useless . That we did not pick up any of the Masks ' signatures . No , it was something else , something that could change the whole hunt for ever if I could prove it , for myself . <newline> <newline> It 's said that the Masked Ones are not all devoid of interest for the BFs . It 's said that the ones that did not become omnipotent and power-crazed chose to stay attached to the places they lived in before they ascended to another state of conscience , before the symbiotic Mask turned them into selfish , immortal , mostly harmless Gods on this earth -harmless as long as you did n't live in an area they ruled over . Someone said only a Masked One can find a Mask and grant it to a BF , and that the transitivity of it all first began when they excavated the first Mask inside the Mojave Desert . Our first God , a woman , was said to have started the first lineage of Masked Ones . How this information had remained unknown to the rest of humanity so far was baffling , and I did not put all my remaining eggs in this crazy basket . But the Mask historian I had talked it out with was pretty convinced . Before the fall of all civilizations , before the Mojave black hole , the disappearance of Japan and the complete destruction of all electronic apparatus , this man had tried to follow the pattern of the Gods ' appearances . He had cross-referenced all Ground Zero events , even the most ridiculous ones , to the background checks on the people known to have become Masked Ones . He found pairs , sometimes triplets of Gods originating from roughly the same areas . Masked Ones created Masked Ones , according to him . I had nothing to lose , and I had heard crazier theories . <newline> <newline> My coming back to New York , my hometown , had not been uneventful . One of the last troups of BFs had sheltered me for a while , before going mad and ripping itself appart , its members succombing to the awful paranoia the newly imposed world order ( or disorder ) and surperimposed crazy magnetic fields inevitably triggered amongst groups of two and more human beings . The Masks completely screw the brain 's chemistry , and the initial instinct of grouping ourselves for survival is sure to slowly transform into a greed-infused paranoia over the remaing Masks , even if the group had swore to never take part in the quest . Poor bastards were probably contaminated by my mere presence . Nobody really knows how it works , which is why people still try to form troups . Guess I ca n't blame them . Now I was walking along the path I used to take to go to work , unsure of what I was going to find . I knew there were other lone BFs in the area , New York is never really deserted , even if the magnetic fields are", "pre": "Your donation will help us bring awareness of the benefits of using this valuable property to raise awareness about our cause and how we are responding."}

The laughing turned into a brief coughing fit . <newline> <newline> The expression on his face turned grim , `` I did n't want to bring this up , but I just ca n't get it off of my mind . He said something to me right before I killed him . '' <newline> <newline> `` Who ? '' <newline> <newline> `` You already know . He said you were going to die . He said he had already gotten to you .

'' Sagramor decided to play into Laoch 's dramatic nature . <newline> <newline> The hero gulped the rest of his tea , stood up with his fist over his heart and kneeled in front of the old man . `` I will accept your wisdom , whatever it may be . '' <newline> <newline> `` Good . This may prove to be your greatest challenge yet . Greater than anything you have faced so far . Are you ready to accept this challenge , soldier ? '' <newline> <newline> The hero hyperventilated . That same feeling of uncertainty from all those years ago came creeping back into the pit of his stomach . With bravado , he puffed his chest and choked out his answer , `` Yes . '' <newline> <newline> `` Good . I ask you , brave soldier , to live . Simply live . Whatever that entails is up to you . '' <newline> <newline> This puzzled Laoch . `` What do you mean ? '' <newline> <newline> `` I ca n't teach you everything . Especially now that I 'm no longer immortal . I 've already taught you everything I know . You 'll learn everything else by choosing to live life . I ca n't teach you how to do that .

In this scene, you don't get to go into the final scene as the ending scene had the characters to be played by the protagonist. (Yes, I could, but I did.) The scene was filled with scenes that were easy to set up and read because they were so large, and even the characters weren't afraid to move things in the direction they wanted to go. (The scenes that were saved were not really the same as the scenes that came before. The characters could be on the other end of the story.) A different theme was also used. It's easy to say that \"The ending scene is another game, but we don't know why,\" and I think that's because you don't really understand the words that are attached to the ending scene, which is kind of ridiculous. (That's all well and good, but the ending scene is not what we wanted to see, so it's not really a good idea to try and keep it in the middle.) Also, if you are playing with the idea of playing a character that can be played over multiple scenes, you can do that in the context of the scene. (It's not something that I would have thought of as a special scene because I know how it worked.) A scene that is of a different sort is another example of the game that was created. It is not a scene that is played, but it is something that was written for. This is something that we have not talked about before, but that was just a part of the ending scene. It's not a fun game. It is an action game. We are talking about how you can make a game that is moving, but you don't have to be a good story to make the scene feel good. (I'm not saying that the ending scene was just the game. It was a good story.) So, if you were thinking about creating a character that would have a different ending for the story, you have to be willing to play with that. That's what we want to do. (I mean, I think there is a lot of room for ambiguity when it comes to creating a story. You want to have fun. You don't want to just do a story. You want to do a story that takes you on a series.

{"question": "You live in a video game . You are not the main character .", "answer": "Gareth woke , his heart pumping with excitement . The day he had dreamt of was finally upon him . Today was his first day as a cleric ! <newline> <newline> Gareth rose from his bed , and walked over to the lone table in his humble dwelling . Dipping his hands into the clay bowl , he splashed water onto his face . The water was frigid , and with a jolt his body seemed to wake up , his skin now prickling with the same exhilaration that he felt in his chest . It was as if his whole being , body and soul , was pulling him out the door and towards the church where his fellow monks were waiting for him . He donned his brown hooded robe , tied the white cord of his Brotherhood around his waist , and walked out the door . <newline> <newline> “ Gareth ! Good morning to you ! ” Father Dormund was the head of their Holy Order , the Brotherhood of the Silver Horn . Gareth had always looked up to him , even though he stood a head shorter . As he greeted Father Dormund with the Brotherhoods customary embrace , Gareth barely managed to clasp his hands around the man ’ s plump frame . <newline> <newline> “ Good morning to you , Father Dormund ! I am looking forward to working with you and my new Brothers to further spread our message . I can not help but feel that I have been created solely for this purpose ! ” <newline> <newline> “ Fantastic ! We shall not delay then . Come , a meeting is planned . We have to discuss a very important matter. ” Father Dormund led the way into the small meeting hall off the main sanctuary . <newline> <newline> As Gareth took a seat , he met Brothers Abernathy and Michael . They too were starting out as new clerics today . Abernathy was a man a few years older than Gareth , a short black beard growing on his chin . Michael , compared even to Father Dormund , appeared very old . His long white beard was so long , he could have tucked it into the cords around his waist . <newline> <newline> “ Brothers , may I have your attention , please ? ” Father Dormund was standing in front of a map of the countryside surrounding their city , Aginhold . His seemed incredibly sullen compared to the man he had met just moments ago . “ Today is a day of great loss . Our dear Brother Derrick has gone missing . He left yesterday on a secret mission . He was taking our Sacred Silver Horn north , to an old Holy Site . Once a year , the Horn must be taken to this Site to be cleansed of evil . As you know , the Silver Horn is special due to its power to steal evil words and thoughts from us and the surrounding lands . It collects all our evil thoughts and words , and in doing so , helps to prevent crime in our land . The evilness must be cleansed from the Silver Horn once a year , or it will cease to work . Brother Derrick was tasked with cleansing the Horn this year , and was due to arrive back today . As you can see , he is not among you , and the Horn is not hanging in our sanctuary ! ” <newline> <newline> “ Father Dormund , ” Gareth couldn ’ t help himself but blurt out , “ What can we do to help ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I was getting to that . I need each of you to go out into the city and the countryside . I want you to look for anyone that might be willing to help us . We will need someone who is strong and cunning to track down our lost Brother Derrick and bring back the Silver Horn . Spread out , tell all of our plight , and pray that someone might be willing to help us ! ” <newline> <newline> Gareth took up a position at Aginhold ’ s southern gate . He anticipated that this would be a good place to look for wandering adventurers , as there was a large seaport to the south that brought new people in every day . Perhaps among one of these newcomers , someone would come who would be able to help him and his Brotherhood . <newline> <newline> Shortly thereafter , he saw a shape coming up the road . A man clad in Bronze armor from head to toe walked directly towards him . <newline> <newline> “ Hello traveler ! ” Brother Gareth began . “ What is your name ? ” <newline> <newline> “ Surfsup619 . Do you have a Quest for me ? ” <newline> <newline> Gareth could barely register the strange name before he found himself responding . “ Yes , Surfsup619 ! I am a member of the Brotherhood of the Silver Horn . Our Sacred Silver Horn has gone missing , along with a member of our order , Brother Derrick . Would you be willing to search for him and bring back our Sacred Horn , and Brother Derrick if possible ? ” <newline> <newline> “ I will accept your Quest . Do you have any clues that I can use to find Brother Derrick ? ” <newline> <newline> “ All I know his he left our church and headed north. ” <newline> <newline> “ Not much to go on . I suppose I ’ ll have to use my Tracking skill to follow his path. ” Without another word , Surfsup619 began to walk into Aginhold , toward the church . <newline> <newline> “ Thank you , kind traveler !

I can recall so much.. all of the subplots and even some of the memorable lines . <newline> <newline> I ’ m not sure what came over me , but at some point , I opened up a Word document . It ’ s strange , but since I was little , I ’ ve always thought about what would happen if I could delete a song , TV show , or movie , or something like that from existence , and then only I would be able to remember it . So then I could recreate it , become rich and famous , and live life free and easy . <newline> <newline> I 'm not gon na question it . TS was the best show ever . A guaranteed hit .

{"question": "Write something that will evoke an emotion that can not be described through words .", "answer": "I had been craving lemon merengue pie for two weeks when I finally found a diner nearby that had it on the menu . The cravings had gotten so bad that my dreams began to revolve around pie . I would wake up every morning with the distant taste of lemon in my mouth , and feeling phantom crumbs on my hands . Enough was enough , so I drove around on my day off , looking for somewhere with lemon merengue pie . When I saw it in the dessert display case at my local diner , I felt more overjoyed about a pastry than I thought was even possible . The hostess lead me to my seat , and handed me a menu .

The creamy merengue was a siren 's call that I was happily going to let lure me to my death . I would quite possibly kill someone for lemon merengue pie at that moment , but it did n't matter . I was going to get my pie soon . <newline> <newline> Lost in my dessert delirium , I did n't hear the waiter approach my table until he spoke . <newline> <newline> `` Sorry , Miss , but we 're out of lemon merengue pie .

It is about being with others and seeing our own future. It is about being who you are and how you can make a difference in the world. It is about recognizing how much we can become in a place to exist and how we are different. It is about making a difference in the world we live in and how we live. It is about trying to get people to be happy and keep that sense of purpose. It is about having more empathy for others and not talking about how to be better in others. It is about being part of a community that is just there for those who are different. It is about being strong and proud to be a part of something that is being called a team. This is a reflection of what we are all in this together and how we are all creating it. If you can't stand up to this battle you can't just be one person and not be one. What is it about the name and the language that is being used that is being used to describe this movement of people? I think it is important to create a movement of people that is not only making people feel, but that is what is happening to them. It is not just about us. It is about how we are to be here and that is not our way. It is not about letting people be. It is about making people feel welcome. It is about making a difference."}

There was something I needed to remember , but I could n't dredge it forward . <newline> <newline> I forced myself to keep moving . I saw an exquisite broadsword , embedded in the wall . The murals depicted a beautiful and ethereal woman standing in the center of the lake , bequeathing the sword to a regal looking man .

Diving into paperwork . Digging into stacks of records . Always searching . Again , my identity eluded me , lurking at the very cusp of consciousness . <newline> <newline> A sling and a heavy rock .

The trial lasted for weeks , and in between court sessions , messages were delivered to me . They alternated between promises of great wealth and of painful deaths . I was driven , ignoring all entreaties and threats . And finally , I was vindicated . I nailed the ones responsible for the murder of my wife and child with tax evasion . <newline> <newline> I had reached the end of the hall . And there stood before me a simple abacus . A robust construction of wood and steel . And I knew this was mine . No murals surrounded it . I reached out to grab it , and the last of the pieces fell into place . I was beaten . Tortured .

Of course the President wanted to be my best friend -- every political figure everywhere wanted to be my best friend . <newline> <newline> So when they told me that I had to murder someone , that there was actually this mystic importance placed on it , when they showed me data , when they got serious about how important it was that I kill and not get caught or the supernatural don't-break-the-masquerade police would execute me on the spot I could n't stop laughing . <newline> <newline> Once I got myself under control , I placed a few calls and made a few donations .

They 're also bound by the laws of the land and ca n't execute me on the spot because what I 'm doing is perfectly legal and they are lawful to a T.

He had explained it several times to the representative , and for some reason the man still did not get the picture . It was a test of the professor ’ s patience , and a trial of his intelligence , but he would try everything to get this man to understand . <newline> <newline> What had pained the professor was the fact that his long reports of the many possibility of the device , seemed to have been ignored .

Furthermore the reports not only mentioned these many possibilities , but the cost effectiveness of any future possible projects . <newline> <newline> And “ they ” sent a person in because of one line dealing with churros . <newline> <newline> “ Image this our world is constructed with a large varieties of metaphysical laws that coincide with the regular boundaries of ... ” explained Professor Drumkit . <newline> <newline> “ Let me stop you ...

He then removed the tape , which allowed a churro to pass through the glass . After a moment another came out before the professor sealed it with a piece of tape . <newline> <newline> “ See ... ” remarked Professor Drumkit . <newline> <newline> “ It makes churros , ” said Steven . <newline> <newline> “ No ... our air is being displaced by a more corporeal material . Ok ... If this portal had been connected to a world like ours then the only thing that would pass through to the other side would be an equal exchange of air , but since their air is more physical then we get substance that pushes on the force of air on our side resulting in a ” siphon ” of material ... do you understand , ” explained Professor Drumkit . <newline> <newline> “ Then who makes the churros ? ” asked Steven . <newline> <newline> “ It could be no one ... it could be a place where the nature ’ s laws are flexed , so that air is churros . The point is this thing , with the appropriate funding , can make an opening to another world with a different set of rules ... a world with oil for air , maybe one with power .

As for the adverts, it seems that the RNC in fact, is giving the high-profile foreign tourists a similar opportunity. While the adage of \"the United States is good for the United States\" is, in reality, a sound strategy for the U.S. that has many advantages, it is also very effective in helping the small, hard-to-swept government-to-be get a fair deal for themselves and their families. The United States is also a very popular country in the world. By far the biggest expense of the new administration is its local government. The Federal Government (the US) is the largest and most popular non-government agency in the world. We do not need to worry about how the foreign government will treat the foreign government or the government in the future. The Administration has already provided some good news for the country. For instance, in November, the United States was appointed as the new president of the United States. In order to do so, the Administration has already begun to consider the possibility of a new U.S. government. The President of the United States is in the process of negotiating a definitive agreement for a \"government of the United States\". The President may, in the future, negotiate a resolution on the policy issues related to the United States. The President has been given a significant role in the administration of the government, and it is clear that he is ready to make the necessary and effective changes to the Administration. However, the President is not yet ready to let the country's government be involved. It is an ideal situation for the President to work together with the government to help the country improve its foreign relations. The President is willing to share the strategy of the United States, which is already doing well in the international arena. The President is ready to work with the President to become the president of the United States. His future is not yet uncertain. The President must be ready for the economic growth of the country. Therefore, the President will be willing to work with the United States and the United States on the development of the economy and the growth of the economy.

All manner of scars and old wounds crisscrossed his back from the telltale pock mark of a grenade to the thin , almost invisible lines of a dagger . The doctor was a Man in his seventies at least , nearly as old as Faith was . His carefully beard had gone white , as had what little hair remained on his head . His hands , thought gnarled and twisted as oak , were calm and steady as he picked up a stainless steel forceps , and moved towards Flint . <newline> <newline> `` I wish I could say this is going to hurt me more than it will you , Captain , but let 's be real .

{"question": "It suddenly becomes possible to gain XP and level up in the real world , but you can only do so by getting kills .", "answer": "Its been like this for years . The kill counters were granted to us by the gods . Each life was worth an objective ammount . This is XP . Levels require an ammount of xp equal to the previous levels ammount + 10 % . The starting ammount every person needs to reach level two is 1000xp . A common housefly is worth 1xp . We quickly figured out a way to tell whether a persons level was based in peace or war based on thier kill count compared to thier level . All kills due to natural causes/ natural disasters were attributed to the earth , its number was visible to all living things just by looking straight down . A constant reminder to remain humble , thats what my father taught me . He and my mother were military , and they drilled it into me that your level is not something to be proud of . `` It is n't a shame to you either . It is only what it is . A representation of survival , a tally marker of suffering . Be it yours or annothers . '' He stressed that there was no shame in ones level . He did this over and over . I was . Born level ten due to my mothers untimely death during childbirth . It wasnt unheard of for babies to be born two or three but for me to be ten was due to how much xp she had accrued during her own life . The level of a living thing alters the ammount it is worth in death . Father is an avid hunter and took me many times in order to alleviate some of my level issues . So i wouldnt have to explain to every new person i meet in life that my mothers death is mine to bear . On one trip i got to learn something special , the higher an animals level the further away you can see its level . We saw a number charging at us throught the trees , being 15 at the time all i saw was a skull , a warning to the lower leveled amongst us to be afraid of a hostile target . My father said it was seventy five . The number is too high for its fresh brown fur to hide , this bear was a manslayer . Never one to back down from a challenge i foolishly raised my rifle . As the shot i had lined up in my mind matched the one my eyes were showing me , the rifle was snatched up and away by my father . Swinging hard into the bears face with the butt of the gun he deftly moved in close with his bowie knife . It glowed in his hands , for anyone else this move was insane . For him it was as quick and easy to butcher that bear as it was to scratch his ass and yawn . He told me that day that every 100 levels youre granted an ability point , the high council frowned on using your abilities in public if they werent for healing . On the night i passed level 100 due to our hunting exploits i described the names of the abilities that were available to me . `` Decisive strike , the one he used to save me . An active class ability available to those who have at least one human kill . '' An inheritance my mother left me i suppose. `` healing light , a mid ranged ability available to be gifted to non-100 persons with no human kills . '' I had seen doctors use that all the time . It took me several minutes to get through the list . At the very bottom one stood out . `` Unique Passive : Blessing of the World '' as i read the words my father turned white . `` What could that even mean ? ? Is there a description alongside it ? '' `` No . '' i replied . `` We have to consult the high council on this one , get in the car . '' `` Sure ... '' I said as i brought up the menu behind my back . As he made it out the front door i selected and confirmed it . Nothing happened , and still it remained there on my stats `` Unique Passive : Blessing of the World . '' During the car ride the radio cut to the news : `` As many of have seen the counter we know to be owned by the earth itself has dissapeared . We are unsure what this means for the future . '' `` To begin with the high council has released statements assuring us that the world is not dead nor can it ever die as it was never alive to begin with . '' As we stood out onto the steps of the capital building the concrete shattered beneath me . I fell only for a moment . A hand reached up to cushion me . Rising from the hole in the ground my new acquaintance and i were met immediately by more guards than you would think could fit in the capital building . Behind the fearful agitated crowd i locked eyes with the leader of the high council . He wasnt afraid . The earth and stone golem turned to me and opened its mouth . To anyone but me it was only the sound of rumbling stone . What i heard it say was as astounding to me as it was to anyone who i would go on to tell : `` You have been chosen as my successor , all that was once mine is now yours , all that will be yours will be that of the earth .

{"question": "You sit alone at a bar , when a man completely clad in black sits down beside you and says , `` The Grim Reaper needs a new protegé . You interested ? ''", "answer": "The last time Jones went out was years ago . Somewhen during the times he attempted to travel around the world by bycicle . Most of his former friends prefered to hang out with their childhood friends , or built a family . It did n't help that Jones was too greedy to party . He knew that after the third drink he would start liking it , start dancing and regret about it weeks later when he needed the money . The Irish pub was the same that he used to frequent back in the days . He went early to secure a seat before the liveband started playing . Whiskey on the rocks was his choice to start the evening . Beer would have made him tired too early and whiskey had more character and flair , that made him wade through his memories with a smile . From time to time he chuckled to himself as he remembered the pensioneer who partied harder than the young folks , or how he clogged the toilet at his former workplace by trying to flush down his stained underwear after a long night out . <newline> <newline> `` May I give you some company , Jones ? '' A black man with eyes the color of a frozen river sat at his table . Jones answered with a smile and a nod . The stranger put an hourglass on the table . Not more than ten minutes were left on the clock . <newline> <newline> `` That 's a nice hourglass . It reminds me of a trophy I received when I played football as a teenager . I 'd bet it 's the same marble and my name was written in the same font . '' Jones said . <newline> <newline> `` He tends to make jokes like that . '' <newline> Jones supposed that the stranger was waiting for him to talk . <newline> `` Why are the last grains not falling ? '' Jones asked , hinting the answer already . <newline> <newline> `` The last one is a heart attack . The old man is looking for an apprentice . He said that he needs a holiday . Whatever that 's supposed to mean . '' <newline> <newline> `` I talked with a headhunter before and I really enjoyed negotiating with him , but there does n't seem to be any room for that here .

You will get a dagger instead of a scythe though . He does n't want to rush it . You have ten minutes to decide . <newline> <newline> The liveband started playing , bar was full and the only sign that was left from the stranger was the running hourglass . Turning it around did n't have the desirect effect as it ignored every law of physics . The kid in him wanted to know what happened if he drops it , but he figured that it was n't time for jokes like that . He thought about the last years and the future . About all the jobs that he did and how much he detested working and not having a choice because of the stupid money . About how it would go on until the last tiny grain passed through . The hourglass hypnotized him . The grains fell and fell unstoppable like a waterfall . `` That 's how it is . '' He mumbled to himself until the hourglass stopped with one grain left . <newline> He did n't have to look up and accepted before the stranger could ask him . The same moment that the man stood up , buttoning his overcoat the hourglass vanished . Jones had a hard time following Death 's lackey to the exit , who was n't bothered by all the people and just walked through them . `` I do n't want to be rude , but what 's your name ?

There are many suspects who have also vanished, and in a sense it is clear that there is no such thing as an early arrival. Their bodies are suddenly found, and the late-night chat is very much a topic of conversation. In the evening, if the Grim Reaper is not as interesting as it seems, it is possible that the Grim Reaper is quite a newcomer, but what it is like to be a Grim Reaper is not a coincidence, but a real event. Here we have the typical suspects, who have to be taken advantage of by the high criminal gang. It is a story of the dead, and the Grim Reaper is not a white man, and it is also a white man. This is a lot of the Grim Reaper. There is no doubt that it is true that the Grim Reaper was a different species of a person. It may be that the Grim Reaper is a perfect black man, and that he is black. There is a lot of knowledge about the Grim Reaper. It is all very well and very well documented, and some of the details are very interesting. But at the end of the day, the Grim Reaper is not a savior. For his achievements in the race, it is possible that he did not succeed in the race. In the meantime, he is in a dangerous position, and his race is very dangerous, and there is a great deal of uncertainty in the race, but the race is great. After a long struggle, he is so strong and tough that it is difficult to see him. When he is not being successful, he is unable to achieve his aims. His race is about to be completely destroyed, and he is at the very least suffering from a bad bloodbath. The Grim Reaper is a special type of race, and the population is very small. People are very young and but they are not really physically active, and as a result, they have a great fear of death. There is a certain amount of psychological tension that arises in the race. The Grim Reaper is a very demanding race, and there is a lot of"}

These species are capable of keeping a similar distance from Earth, and have a much shorter lifespan than Earth. 'Hungy-bloom' was first introduced to Earth in about 2,000 years ago.

{"question": "every human is born with the ability to freeze time . However this `` time freeze '' only freezes other people who have used their ability as well . You have never felt the need to use your power , and so you are the last person on earth to be immune to time freezes . Tell your story", "answer": "I look for movements . <newline> <newline> <newline> That 's what I have been doing for the longest time . You see , it was n't like this in the beginning . At first , it was the most interesting scientific phenomenon , at least that 's what they say . It seemed that , at random time intervals , some babies would just freeze . No , they were n't dead , they just did n't move . No breath , no flinching . As if they were statues of wax , and not made of flesh and bones . And in matter of few years , it spread to toddlers and older kids as well . <newline> <newline> <newline> As the days went by , the occurrences grew in number and popularity . It became number one story in the media . People were talking about it everywhere . Sometimes , I look up the articles of that time , the time before I was even born . How simple it must have been ! Not having to see statues of humans all the time around you . I look at the video recordings from the earlier time . They are the only movements I have seen around . <newline> <newline> <newline> Some called it will of God , and some called it trick of Satan . People came together to pray . Governments came together to talk . Scientists came together to experiment . No one could stop it . Then some wise man in white coat somewhere figured out that it happened to all those who were born after a certain date . In hindsight , it was pretty obvious . One of the biggest attempt of mankind to understand time and space had created a situation with hundreds of more questions . <newline> <newline> <newline> Governments urged the youngsters not to use it . But they were young ! And it was n't like they could catch everyone who tried it . I still remember the reports I read about the mass executions in the Middle East . They were n't the only ones to enforce the law against these young Time-Stoppers . <newline> <newline> <newline> And the chaos continued . There was no way to turn it around . Everyone who was born now had the power . Power to freeze the life of everyone who had every used the power . Whenever someone was seen frozen , they called the special men in black uniform . They would come in their big van with the sirens and execute the frozen person right there and then . I guess they wanted to get people scared about it . But it was n't really under anyone 's control . When it comes to human brain , there is always entanglement of emotions . The trigger was different for everyone . The most common trigger was anger . Someone pissed you off , you ca n't control it and bang ! Now you are one of them . No matter for how small amount of time you used it for , no matter whether you wanted to or not , you did it . And now you were one of them . They say the government had locked up some of them and would torture them everyday till they would agree to freeze time for half an hour . And that 's when the black men in uniform used to crawl through the streets . No property was private , no house was a home . They were everywhere and they were merciless . I still remember the video that spread through the social media before everything broke down . It was just another execution in the street , but this time , the guy woke up just before the execution and tried to get away . But they had to finish the job . I still remember it all , his vain attempts to run , his frantic pleading , him clutching his family photo to the chest and closing of eyes . And then blood . So much of it . I think that 's when people started losing hope . And so did my dad . <newline> <newline> <newline> My mom was crying one day and she did n't return home the next day . That 's all I remember . My father sobbing . He told me that she was in a better place . I did n't know what that meant then . Must have been somewhere far , somewhere time was still our friend . But my dad taught me how to control myself , how not to lose focus . <newline> <newline> <newline> So of course the Time-Stoppers revolted . Some say it was started by the ones who escaped from the government . The reports of missing people and dead bodies found everywhere .

Into the velvet sleeve it went where another boy much like myself might slide it out from it ’ s hiding place to give it the cleaning and maintenance the Monocled Man needed . Although with the way my charge had been shooting I doubt it ’ d make much of a difference . <newline> “ Your answer boy ? ” The Monocled Man exclaimed . “ I asked you a question you know. ” <newline> “ Oh , right… ” I glanced up from the delicate firearm in my hands . “ What was that again ? '' <newline> “ The hunt my boy ! ” The Monocled Man lay a pair of hands on my head and shook playfully . “ Sir Walleye ’ s annual hunt ! I wouldn ’ t want any other boy but you there ! ” He pulled a pipe from beneath a pocket in a pinstriped vest , tucked a knuckle full of tobacco inside , and struck the mound . “ You absolutely must come !

To be quite honest , I was hoping to make it through my time with the Monocled Man without attending any hunts , being careful to avoid Sir Walleye ’ s particularly .

I ’ ll have your things packed and ready by the week ’ s end ! It will be absolutely splendid ! ” Again his hands landed on my shoulders , almost shaking the gun from my grasp . He strode off the yard and into his manor leaving clouds of blue smoke in his wake . I hurried after with the Monocled Man ’ s gun , careful to avoid the toxic fumes now consuming his grounds . Tobacco was against the rules too . <newline> I looked back across my charge ’ s yard to see a field full of unmolested clay pigeons nesting among the weeds . Not a single on had been struck by the Monocled Man ’ s birdshot . <newline> Unfortunately for my charge ’ s sake , the same can not be said for the tiger . No , when it came to my Monocled Man , the tiger of Sir Walleye ’ s hunt made no tactical errors at all . No tactical errors indeed .

No outfit looked good on my body , no matter how hard I tried , and I could n't find half my clothes . Must be in the washer . It did n't matter anyway , nothing fit me anymore . It looked as though my belly spilled over the top of my jeans , and you could see so much flab coming out from the bottom of my shirt . I needed to go shopping . <newline> <newline> I put my hair in a ponytail , deciding not to waste time on it . I needed to get to school . Though it was relatively warm out , I was a little chilly . I grabbed my boyfriend 's sweatshirt and put it on , a little satisfied that it covered my muffin top . I walked downstairs where my mom was frantically getting breakfast ready . <newline> <newline> My little snot of a younger brother was tearing pieces of toast apart and throwing them on the ground when Mom was n't looking . He hated toast , but it looked like Mom had stayed up most of last night and woke up late this morning , meaning toast was on the menu . I bent down and picked up the pieces , putting it back on his plate . He was only six , but that did n't phase me . <newline> <newline> `` Now you have to eat it after it 's been on the floor . Stop making life hard for Mom . '' I said . <newline> <newline> `` Haley ! '' Mom scolded , grabbing the plate away from Gavin . She gave another piece of toast to him , and he swore up and down he would n't do it again . <newline> <newline> `` Do n't give your brother dirty food . I did n't get the floor cleaned last night . I was pretty busy . '' Mom said , running her hand through her hair . She grabbed her coffee mug and took a few sips . <newline> <newline> `` Busy doing what ? '' I asked . She fell silent . Whatever it was , she did n't dare say it in front of Gavin , so I decided to drop it . <newline> <newline> Dad was coming over today to take us both to school . I had n't seen him in a few months . Mom won custody , and ever since , I only saw him during school breaks . Spring break was just around the corner , and since today was the last day , he was in charge of taking us to school that morning . <newline> <newline> A piece of toast came flying in my direction , and I just barely dodged it . <newline> <newline> `` Gavin , you little- '' the doorbell rang . <newline> <newline> Dad was standing at the door . He looked like he had n't slept in days . His eyes were red and his shirt looked dirty . When I opened the door , he gave me a half smile . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , Haley . '' He said that quietly . He looked at me sympathetically . Not that I do n't love my dad , but it was a little weird the way he was acting towards me . My mom came to the front door to greet him , something she never does . She handed him an envelope . <newline> <newline> `` You have everything that 's needed ? '' She asked . She looked like she was about to cry . I 'm not sure what the hell happened between the two of them , but it was starting to freak me out . Dad nodded , and asked to come in . My mom said yes . <newline> <newline> It was weird for my mom and dad to be in the same room and not argue . They were perfectly quiet and civil towards each other , and I had a slight fear that they may have caught me doing something . I searched in my memory anything that they would want to punish me for , and came up with nothing , which only made me more anxious . <newline> <newline> My mom put my plate in front of me . Eggs and toast . I loved my mom 's cooking , so I felt bad not eating it . <newline> <newline> My mom seemed overly joyed to eat her food , as did my dad . They both started talking about how great breakfast was , and about how I should try it . <newline> <newline> I always got so angry when people talked about food and how good it was , and lately my mom has been pushing me to eat it . I knew how good it was , I just did n't want to eat it . You 'd think they 'd stop after a while , but the requests kept getting worse . My mom would go through hoops to try to make me eat , including taking me to fancy restaurants and cooking my favorite meals . It seemed as though every time I did n't want to eat , she 'd try shoving it down my throat , and I 'd get sick . No wonder I was fat . <newline> <newline> After breakfast , I grabbed my backpack and walked to dad 's car . He came around to the front and started the car . <newline> <newline> `` Where 's Gavin ? '' I asked . <newline> <newline> `` He 's not coming , '' Dad said . `` He said he felt sick . '' <newline> <newline> `` And of course Mom fell for it , '' I sighed . `` She always does .

The story's ending will be well-written, full of mystery, and with some tension that you're going to struggle to put into words. The story does come across as more of an annoying group of people trying to figure out the truth. One of the things that is so beautiful about it is that it is so much more than that. It is the story that is really happening, that is real, and it is a lot of fun. You have to be willing to understand the story because it is something that really drives you. There are different versions of it, but there are so many. I am sure there are many. One of the most amazing ones is the story of George Martin. The story is told in a different way. There is a lot of fear in the story. It is a story of faith, and that's what I wanted to say. This story is very sad and sad. There are so many stories, but I want to keep it so that you can tell me what is real and what is not. I am sure that if you are a parent, a parent, or a child, you will feel that what you are saying is true, and that there is no point in believing in a God who is not going to believe in you. There are times when you feel that you have to do something and you are doing that. I am not saying that you are a bad person, but it is possible. It is about being a parent. There is something about being a parent, and you are dealing with that because you are not being viewed as the only person in your life. I think that is the best thing that can happen for a child. I think that the reason I am saying this is because I was having the conversation with a friend about a story that was written, and it was so fun. I was wondering how I would say that, and how I felt about that story. I think it is important. I would like to understand that even if you are very different, you can be different and that is something that you are not comfortable with. I think that is a very important thing. I am not saying that I am not a mom. I am just saying that I can't help you. I think that you are going to be in a good place. I am not saying that you have to be an actor"}

She asked obscure questions like `` But WHY is the sky blue , instead of purple , or green , or even PINK !

{"question": "“ …in this world nothing can be said to be certain , except taxes . ”", "answer": "Professor Hollinsworth had a need to understand . It 's what brought him to the top of his field in theoretical physics . It 's also what found him at his desk at 3 in the morning , pouring over 74,608 pages of U.S. tax code . The same urge that sent him to his garage to tear apart the engine of his car if he did n't understand what the mechanic was telling him was wrong , and had driven him study the technical manuals for his DVD player when it started skipping , now compelled him to *understand* why his most recent grant had somehow ran afoul of some obscure tax regulation . No matter that the university had accountants and attorneys sort this sort of thing out , talented experts and professionals who had assured him that it would be fine , and that it was just a matter of some extra paperwork ... Hollinsworth had to *understand* . <newline> <newline> There was nothing unusual in his focus , or in the hour . On any other night , he would have been pouring over his real work . He knew he was close , closer than anybody had been before , but when it came to the fundamental nature of reality an existence , close was n't good enough . It was all or nothing . Either he managed to identify the singular `` theory of everything '' ... or he did n't . <newline> <newline> He had n't expected his foray into tax code to have any bearing on his usual work . It was just another curiosity he was compelled to satisfy . But after the fifth hour or so , he felt it . The wordless , almost formless , half thought in the very back of his head , whispering `` there 's something here '' . He could n't shake the feeling that the something in question was n't related to his grant . <newline> <newline> An hour later , he pulled out his handwritten physics notebooks , and opened to a page of penciled formulas . It could n't be ... and yet it was . The missing piece of the puzzle he and his small army of graduate students had been struggling with for years . How ? <newline> <newline> He opened his laptop , and started typing in to the search bar . `` Tax code of . '' Almost at random , he picked the United Kingdom from the list of suggested searches . A few clicks later , and an hour of reading , and he found it ... buried in a subsection related to agricultural emission subsidies . China and India next . The English translations were not as precises as he needed to verify his findings , but were close enough to suggest a match . He started pulling up tax codes from every English speaking nation he could think of . It was all the same . <newline> <newline> The unified theory of everything ... was taxes . The uncertainty principle did n't apply . It would take years to verify the findings to the satisfaction of the scientific community , but he already knew he had the answer .

{"question": "You live in a world where walking a mile in someone else 's shoes gives you one of their skills . You work in a used shoe store .", "answer": "ThumpThumpThumpThumpThumpThump <newline> <newline> Miles focused on the sound of his shoes smacking the pavement as he tore up Century Drive . It was all he could do to ignore his heavy wheezing , wet and rattling at this point from the two miles it took to get to Anderson ’ s . The day was bright and hot , the air crisp and clean ; a perfect June morning . Such a waste that it would be Miles ’ first day of summer work . <newline> <newline> And he was late . <newline> <newline> Down the street and left at the light sat a quaint and not very curious place of business . It looked much like any other with a dusty brown awning that read “ Anderson ’ s ” in elaborate but faded white letters . Behind the glass door sat a man at the front desk chewing an unlit pipe and reading the morning paper . He seemed unbothered by the lack of business and quite peaceful behind his thick rimmed glasses and under his bushy brow and wrinkles . Time was of least concern to him . <newline> <newline> The door swung open and the bells attached jangled angrily . The man did not look up to greet the boy but instead chuckled as he finished off a comic strip . Miles huffed and set his hands akimbo struggling to speak . But before he could get out a word the man spoke . <newline> <newline> “ Well , I suppose one should consider this a bad first impression hmm ? But I would be lying if I said I am surprised or even disappointed . You clearly did your best to get here and best was not enough . We ’ ll look past it today and see how tomorrow fares , hmm ? Come on then , let ’ s get started . We ’ ve wasted enough time. ” <newline> <newline> And with one surprisingly swift motion he had risen from his chair and strode through a door leading to a back room . Miles stood puzzled for a moment before cautiously following . <newline> <newline> The back room was far grander than Miles had anticipated . It reminded him of a study , or a library . The difference here being that instead of walls and shelves lined with books , they were stacked with shoes . <newline> <newline> Hundreds if not thousands of shoes . <newline> <newline> Some in boxes , some just single sided , all carefully separated and tagged . As Miles followed he glanced at the florescent green and orange tags . <newline> <newline> 8M RNG <newline> <newline> 8W ACCT <newline> <newline> 7W FLR <newline> <newline> He could make sense of the size , but the letters that followed remained a mystery to him . The man turned to face Miles suddenly . <newline> <newline> “ Tomorrow we ’ ll go through the more important details of your job . For now , I want you to do three things. ” <newline> <newline> Miles stared at him awaiting instructions . <newline> <newline> “ One , my name is Mr. Anderson . You will find that I am relaxed in most cases and understanding in even more cases than that . I do believe that a name , much like a label or title , is important . We will treat it with the value it deserves . Two , you will begin to sort each of the unpaired shoes into the four empty aisles on that side of the room. ” Back turned to Miles , the man lifted his hand lazily gesturing to a group of vacant rows. ” <newline> <newline> Then strolling towards the front of the shop once again Mr. Anderson turned to face Miles . He stopped for a moment and seemed lost in thought , running his fingers lightly up and down one of the shelves . <newline> <newline> “ Finally , for the moment , you are not to go through the room at the back of this one. ” <newline> <newline> His tone indicated that this was of utmost importance . And with that Mr. Anderson disappeared once again to the front of the shop leaving Miles to begin his first day at the cobbler ’ s . <newline> <newline> The work was boring , but it became almost relaxing over time . As Miles worked he would pause and probe the shoes . Some appeared to have been there for ages . Far longer than the typical one week repair time usually expected . Others seemed dated and forgotten by time , but certainly not forgotten by Mr. Anderson as their tags were fresh and without a crease . It was all a mystery to Miles why his father would have felt this a good “ lesson ” for him to learn this summer . For now though , Miles was content to have some change to enjoy on the evenings and weekends . Looking down at his own beaten tennis he noticed that part of the sole had ripped away from the body , possibly due to a combination of age and his earlier haste to get to the shop on at a reasonable hour . <newline> <newline> At around noon , Mr. Anderson stepped into the room and announced “ That ’ s fine . Come up front. ” Before turning on his heel and disappearing once again . Miles placed a single shoe on a shelf taking careful note of his progress before hurrying to the front . He had barely closed the storage room door before Mr. Anderson spoke . <newline> <newline> “ Take those shoes off . They ’ ll need some repair. ” <newline> <newline> Miles had barely noticed their state himself and had not noticed Mr. Anderson look at him for more than a brief moment so the statement caught him somewhat off", "pre": "You are one of the few people who can be trusted.

{"question": "Write a story in which a character slowly loses his empathy and humanity because of how society treats him as well as having us empathize with him .", "answer": "( 1/2 ; I 'll post the 2nd part below ) <newline> <newline> I work the night shift . People on television call it the 'graveyard shift ' or 'third watch ' , but the 8pm-4am paramedic shift is unique to the night because all deaths have their patterns . The most common time to die of a heart attack is mid-morning , and more specifically on a Monday . The most common time for a slip-and-fall accident is 3pm on a Thursday . Spousal abuse is 6:30pm on a Friday if the victim lives , and 11:30pm Friday if the victim dies . And the most common time to die in a drunk-driving related crash is 2:45am Sunday morning . So my shift defines my patients , and I work nights . <newline> <newline> Certain things about working a night job are hypnotically calm . I walk to the 24hr grocery store at 4:15am , bypassing the empty lines as I stroll right up to check-out with my basket and get everything scanned in a flash by the lone clerk wearing the nametag 'Tim ' . Somehow I do n't think it 's his real name . I go home where my roommate Shane is stumbling back at the same time that I am , counting his cash from another day 's artificial flirting at the gay club where he tends bar . When he 's not around sometimes I go to the corner bar to play pool with the regular crowd of crackheads and tweaks still up at this time of night , descending on the only bar in town I know that 's open to nightcrawlers like me . Finally I sleep in a bedroom where I 've covered the window in tin foil so the sunlight does n't stream through and wake me up at 8 or 11am before I actually wake up at 3 . It 's not a lot of sleep , I admit . I rarely get to bed before 8am , which to 'normal ' people would be like a 9pm curfew , but I ca n't sleep much later without having a sense of shame at the wasted day ahead . I wake up , cook some 4pm breakfast , and go run a few sets of stadiums at the convention center as the sun starts to set over the pier . The African man and his wife are here again . They 're here at least three times a week , and while he 's in gym clothes she wears a full , colorful fabric garb and large headwrap , running up and down the stadium stairs as he encourages her in a language I do n't understand . They seem genuinely happy . It 's curious . <newline> <newline> I get to work shortly before 8pm and change into my uniform . I 'm still relatively new to nightshift and it 's nice to catch up with the noon-8pm crowd . Most car crashes ( non-drinking ) happen at 5:30pm . I 'm a whiz with the jaws of life . <newline> <newline> Today 's Friday , so the gears do n't really start up until the drunken fight calls and gang violence roll in after 9pm . You 'd think those calls would be later into the night once the bars are closing , but the gang neighborhood issues usually sprawl out earlier ; 9-10ish , while the bar fights are more towards 2 . Those are relatively easy because I 'm in a public environment so it 's really just a grab-and-go call ; get them in the rig and on our way . What 's stranger to me are the calls that invite you into the personal lives of others ; getting a 911 call to someone 's home and filling your head with the full context of where and how people live . You 're not just picking up a drug overdose patient . You 're picking up a drug overdose patient in a run-down house with rotting food in the cabinets , the thick , humid stench of waste in the bathroom , and a screaming toddler in soiled clothes reaching up from the make-shift playpen they 've been placed in hours before . We call Child Protective Services for the kid but we 'll never find out what happened . Not until someone calls 911 again . <newline> <newline> The highest statistical frequency for child abuse ( pre-K ) is around 1pm . I once went to the home of a man who duct-taped his four year old son 's arms together and burned him in the eye with a cigar . Apparently the kid was hyper and running , and the duct-tape/cigar combo was a lesson to stay put . I do n't have any nieces or nephews yet so I 'm not sure what the correct punishment is supposed to be . That call was early in my career , and I was pretty upset by what I saw . Whenever I have a particularly bad case we inevitably have to clean our ambulance afterwards , so I get a bit of time back at our station for decontamination and I used to spend a minute in the bathroom running the sink 's warm water over my hands . It was like an 'all clear ' sign to me , that I 've left the call , cleaned myself of it , and am back to normal . Warm water on your wrists is incredibly calming . Today I had three cases of spousal abuse , a few car crashes , bar fights , and a yard fire . One of the abuse cases was victim to a frying pan , which was a new method to see . When I finish work , I swing by the 24hr grocery , buy my stir-fry dinner from Nametag Tim , and go", "pre": "......................"}
{"question": "Retell the origin of a superhero , but reveal the hero at the end of the story .", "answer": "My Aunt makes the best meatloaf in the history of the universe . <newline> <newline> I 'm dead serious . Go , right now , read every history book you can possibly find on the incredibly specific subject of meatloaf . You will not find my Aunt 's cooking mentioned at length , or at all , in any of them . But take my word for it . Her meatloaf rocks . <newline> <newline> That 's why I wish we had gotten the news on a night when I was n't eating her delicious , home-cooked meatloaf . I was in the kitchen , at our dinky little coffee table-that-isn't-really-meant-for-meals in our dinky little house in Queens . I had my laptop open , propped up on one knee actually , and was browsing the web for information on the upcoming episode of Doctor Who .

'' <newline> <newline> She went to washing dishes , and I went back to Google , proving her totally right . After the `` incident '' , sure , some things changed majorly .

She went very still , she did n't break down in great , dramatic sobs like you always see on soap operas . She just thanked the officer for his time , closed the door , and turned back to me . I was so much more scared by the look on her face than I 've ever been in my entire life . All the strength in her was just gone . <newline> <newline> `` Your Uncle is dead . '' She said . Just like that , plain and simple , like a slap to the face . My Aunt spoke with such confidence , even then , I thought maybe she was pulling a prank . <newline> <newline> `` How ? '' I said . My voice squeaked . I was really hoping it was a joke . <newline> <newline> `` He was on the street , unlocking his car . There was a man , some thug , he ... '' And here , finally , my Aunt broke down into soft sobs . `` Oh , god , he shot him . He 's dead . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh , my god , '' I said , and I could n't think of anything else to add because there was nothing to add . Words do n't solve that kind of hurt , and they do n't bring people back from the dead . Only deeds do that . That 's what I learned that night . That was the beginning of my story . At least , that 's what I like to think , anyway . <newline> <newline> <newline> ~~~ <newline> <newline> <newline> One month later , and here I am , with a mask on my face and the wind blowing elegantly through my hair . Well , not really that second thing , because , y'know- I have a mask on my face . But the wind is blowing really hard up here on top of this building , and if it were n't for the mask , that would make it a lot more difficult to see the bank robbery taking place down below . <newline> <newline> Wow , those guys have really scary looking guns . <newline> <newline> Okay , I can do this . Nothing to it . I just leap down onto the street , use these amazing powers of mine , the way my Uncle would have wanted . The way I should have been all along .

This whole 'Spider-Man ' thing is n't so difficult afterall . <newline> <newline> <newline> -- -- -- -- -- <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> I figure this one is pretty obvious from the get-go , since Spider-Man 's origin story has been done to death .

Each generation or so , warriors come to the hall to inherit a weapon that they are worthy enough to wield . Across the hall you see a forgotten weapon that 's been collecting dust .

The mighty hall in which I stood sat in the midst of a great forest . Marble pillars held the roof up stretching a football field ’ s length high . The room itself was rectangular , shelves lined the room like book cases with a large aisle down the middle . Several more platforms of shelves climb along the walls . On the shelves sat weapons of all shapes and sizes , little note cards sat in front of them . There was no doubt in my mind , This was Heorot . <newline> <newline> I walked up to one of the shelves , on it rested a sword . I snapped up the note card and looked at it <newline> <newline> Excaliber , sword of British kings , when used allows the assertion of one ’ s sovereignty over others .

A note card set on a pedestal , it read : <newline> <newline> The magic of these items are dangerous to other artifacts , remove with caution . <newline> <newline> The door creaked open , it opened on a small room . A stone table was placed in the middle of the room . Two spears lied on it , the longer one was yellow , the shorter red .

Avoid self harm and partake caution when holding near other magical weapons . <newline> <newline> I lifted the spears .

This was the best day of his entire life . The retired assassin has been dreaming of this moment for the past six years . Every fucking night .

His life was full of pain , murders and suffering , nothing to be proud of and nothing to tell his children . Luckily , the old chap didn ’ t have any children to disgrace . In truth , he had nothing to live for and the only reason to be still alive was the signed contract with his old friend who was the legendary vocalist of Vengaboys .

No , it wasn ’ t money or fame , his friend wanted to die , but why ?

{"question": "A strange virus has caused blindness in all humans over a two week period . You are immune , but have n't told anyone .", "answer": "I mean , I 'd tell people , but then they 'd just want me to *do* shit . <newline> <newline> Okay , I 'd probably better explain . To who , I have no idea , since nobody can fucking read . Whatever . Let 's make this a letter to me . Dear me : remember when everyone went blind because of that stupid virus ? <newline> <newline> At first it was not so bad , people thought you had to eat at Chipotle to get it and all it did was make you puke and shit your brains out for a while . Then about a year later those same puke-and-shitters started going blind . That 's when people started to panic . Then Chipotle went out of business . Then people figured out it was n't even Chipotle to begin with . Something in the water supply . Too late . Everyone got it . <newline> <newline> Things slowed down real fast . Airports closed , then nobody was driving anywhere . People walking into stores and just taking food , what they could figure out was food . We saw our neighbor down at the corner shop trying to eat a bag of cat chow , not sure what she thought it was . That was before Mom went blind . <newline> <newline> Look , I did n't ask for any of this shit to happen . I mean nobody did , but all I wanted was to sit in my room playing Xbox like I 've always done . I do n't ask much out of life . Was n't popular in school and not smart enough for college . Things after high school smoothed out okay . Mom had her social security check to live on and we did okay . I spent most nights and afternoons sitting in my room playing Xbox on the 32-inch plasma I bought by saving up from my job at the corner shop . Then after the virus I did n't even have to go to work anymore which was fine by me , those people suck . And since I knew I 'd not be able to play games pretty soon , I stayed in my room and played . I wanted to finish Far Cry 6 , at least . <newline> <newline> And I did . So I started on the new Assassin 's Creed . And finished it . <newline> <newline> And I started Dark Souls 4 , which I 'd been putting off since last year . <newline> <newline> And I finished it . <newline> <newline> By then I knew something was happening . <newline> <newline> Or at least , something *wasn't* happening . <newline> <newline> Look , I 'm not a fucking asshole , I still made sure Mom had food every day , and I made sure the house was protected -- things started getting shitty outside by then . The clumsiest fucking gangs of raiders were roaming around by then , but they were easy to stay ahead of . A few boards over the windows , lock the doors , stay quiet . You know what it 's like to face off with a group of angry blind looters ? It 's fucking retarded easy . <newline> <newline> I think the only thing I really did wrong was I did n't tell Mom I could still see . <newline> <newline> I think she 's starting to suspect , though . She keeps feeling her way down the hallway to my room and hearing sounds from the game through the door . `` What 's that ? '' she yells . <newline> <newline> `` It 's just one of my games , '' I say back . `` I just put it on for noise , I like the sounds . '' <newline> <newline> `` VICTORY ! BOSS DEFEATED ! '' goes the game . I do n't think Mom knows what it means , but I think she 's starting to suspect . <newline> <newline> Something will change soon . I already went down to Best Buy and took all the games from the Xbox section . I 'll run out of new ones to play within another three months or so , they 're not making any more new ones . After that I 'll play through some of the ones I liked again . But after that ? <newline> <newline> I 'll probably have to tell somebody . Starting with Mom . And she 'll probably tell other people .

I do n't think I 've mentioned that the people of Judea had a shared religion .

But there were other saints in Rome. According to the Vatican website, the Pope's power is \"the power of the Holy Spirit in the image of the Holy Spirit\". The Vatican's Pope Francis is the head of the Church and the leader of the Church of the Holy Trinity in Rome, who oversees the Vatican's budget.

The Vatican's cardinal and vice-chancellor were the principal priests of the Vatican. The Vatican's official position is that the cardinal was the founder of the pope's commission on the Church. The Vatican had to be \"aware of the events of the past four centuries, and the Vatican is known for its efforts to strengthen and strengthen the church\". In the Vatican's official document, the pope \"says\" that the pope \"has all but declared his faith in God.\" The Vatican has been paying priests and bishops their money since the beginning of the church's existence, but that it is taking the Vatican into its own hands and being a Catholic institution.

{"question": "The sky is falling , and you are an old man", "answer": "Gerald sat on his back porch , staring contentedly at his back yard , a glass of iced tea slowly warming in the late afternoon sun . No thoughts crossed his mind , at his age thoughts were n't a necessity and only showed up when something of import hove itself in front of him . Two minutes or two hours , it did n't matter how long he 'd sat there , he was enjoying the warmth , the sound of the light breeze , and not thinking . It was his favorite past time , aside from yelling at the TV . <newline> <newline> His reverie was shattered with the sound of a whistle and a heavy thunk from the yard . Thoughts now came into his mind unbidden and without so much as an invitation . Probably just some neighbor kid threw a football too hard , he thought , it 'll teach him a good lesson if he never gets it back . <newline> <newline> With the slow grace of semi-warm marmalade , he unfolded himself from his high-backed rocking chair , achieved something that vaguely resembled an upright posture , and descended the short stairs to the grass that he so lovingly maintained . If a single blade is out of place , he thought again , there will be hell to pay . <newline> <newline> An object sat in the middle of his yard , bits of dirt clung to it 's sides , and it steamed quietly to itself . As Gerald inched closer , he could see that it was no football , that it appeared to be a hunk of glass , about the size of a cantaloupe . It 's edges were sharp and showed signs of recent fracture , much the same way that old obsidian arrowheads do . Puzzled by this odd intrusion into his world , Gerald descended to his knees to examine it closer . He retrieved the ancient set of bifocals from his shirt pocket , wiping them with a corner of his handkerchief and placing them precariously on the end of his nose . <newline> <newline> What he beheld was no ordinary bit of melted silica and soda ash . From deep within the glass came a cyan color of incredible intensity yet no direct source of illumination or focal point . It was as if the glass itself radiated blue , yet there was no single source from which the blue came . Tentatively , Gerald reached out a gnarled hand , and touched the material . It was warm , warm like bread fresh out of the over , yet also mildly electric . Gerald withdrew his hand and pondered some more . A passing airplane , perhaps ? He craned his back as far as his advanced years would allow him to . <newline> <newline> Nothing up there . A passing bird , and a leaf on the wind . He watched it soar for a moment , before it passed out of sight . <newline> <newline> Just then , another whistle and thunk , this time of greater magnitude . A second piece , this one about the size of Gerald 's TV , now lay in the freshly tilled earth of his garden . It , too , steamed and radiated the same incredible sky-blue color . <newline> <newline> Sky blue . Another intrusive thought . <newline> <newline> Gerald scanned the skies again , this time seeing something . A blackness , a small piece of nothing up there above his head . His wizened face scrunched up in thought , now that he needed thoughts none decided to show up . Ungrateful thoughts , oughta be ashamed of themselves . <newline> <newline> As he stared into the black , he saw it suddenly grow bigger , and a glint move across the sky . The glint grew bigger and bigger , seeming to rush towards Gerald much like an old friend would , if Gerald had any old friends anymore . With a piercing shriek instead of a mild whistle , a much larger piece of glass plowed into the corner of Gerald 's porch , a great crashing boom that sent pieces of wood flying everywhere , dirt splattering across the sides of the modest house , and the glass of iced tea somewhere into the neighbor 's yard . Stunned and shocked , Gerald could not come up with any response other than to gape at what just happened . <newline> <newline> He turned and looked upward at that black spot . Now long , thin , creeping black arms appeared to radiate out of the spot , ever widening , branching , reconnecting , splintering anew . A memory clicked to life in Gerald 's mind , when he was 23 and went ice fishing with his father , and he got into an area where the ice was too thin . Watching the ice do the same thing , knowing that at any moment it would collapse and he would drown . The same fear of death he had then came to him now , his old heart racing with adrenaline , his hands shaking . A much larger piece now hurtled earthward , slamming with incredible force into his neighbors house , flattening it completely and knocking over the great old oak tree that had stood in front of the house for almost 200 years . Tears came from Gerald 's eyes . The sky , literally , was falling down around him .", "pre": ". The men and women in your life have heard of the moon, and they have seen the moon and the moon.

{"question": "Describe a magical place . No story , just the scene .", "answer": "Magick 's End marks the beginning of the end of magick . Seventy some odd hundred years ago , two of the most powerful mages took their hosts and clashed over the most inhospitable mountain range in the frozen south . Legend tells us that the two clashed so fiercely that a false sun hung in the sky through the night . That all the Divines ' descended from Cestel and stood watch around , powerless to intervene . Forced to stand aside as two men rent the universe to align with their conflicting wills . That Mysteria stood too close when Magick gave up reconciling with this world which is why she has n't been seen in the night sky since . Existence , with a dejected sigh that echoed round the world , simply stopped bothering with that place . <newline> <newline> Men like legends which put them above the Divines . The truth is , as near as anyone ever bothered to record , is that no one made it out of there to record what actually happened . History goes back and forth about which one of the two actually won ; both accounts had the same effect on the world making the whole thing completely pointless . <newline> <newline> In fact , the only reason people even bother to discuss that battle is Magick 's End . You have this perfectly fine and untouched mountain range , that even snowmen wear sweaters when visiting , abruptly interrupted by a cube where the land is just missing . Like a loose brick that fell out of a wall and crumbled on the land below . Its not like someone just set off a part of the mountain range by conjuring up the most ornery of volcanoes ; we have many mages who have done that in history and they 're not that remarkable . Something just came along and cut a space out of the fabric of the land and sewed in a discolored patch . <newline> <newline> Light bends around it as often as it will shine on it , revealing a smooth stone gray surface sunk into the ground . Sometimes that surface shatters with horrendous quakes ; other times it rolls and crashes like the ocean . I once saw the surface drip stony gray rain onto the ceiling above , which coalesced into jagged gray boulders that rained down , splashing more gray drops onto the the ceiling . Sometimes it is day in Magick 's End while the rest of the world rests in the night . Magical scholars , philosophers and clerics alike have pondered and guessed at the meaning of this place for those seventy some odd hundred years and they could conclude nothing . No , not that they could n't come up with anything ; that the meaning of the place was literally nothing . If anything I 've said of this place caught your attention , let it be this : The universe abandoned this place long ago , all the better if we do too .", "pre": "A woman can be a woman.

The filmmakers have to be courageous to save the lives of their friends and family. This movie is about the struggle and is about life. The movie takes place in a small town in India. It is a city where the police, police and a police officers are being killed. The hero, who is an enemy to the world, is the leader of the class. He is not a member of the kingdom but he is a member of the ruling class. In order to make peace, the hero has to be free and he is not the hero.

{"question": "Write the most elaborate , over-dramatic , and exciting story you can think of that all just turns out to be a set-up for a pun so horrible I 'll want to punch you", "answer": "In the 17th century there was a man named Nicholas Molineux . Nicholas was from a rather lowly family and was a prodigy with the violin , but despite his amazing talent he could n't manage to make a name for himself in the world of music , due to the large numbers of talented violinists at the time . But he loved playing his violin so he kept at it . For years he played what gigs he could get , but never managed to catch the public eye . Then one day he was approached and asked to play for an opera . He accepted , learnt his music and showed up for rehearsals . It was there that he first saw Annalette . Annalette came from a very wealthy family , and was a wonderful singer but , despite her wealth and talent , she had a kind soul . Nicholas noticed this very quickly and fell for her almost as fast . After some courting he discovered that she too had feelings for him . the two fell deeply in love and Nicholas soon asked her father for his blessing to marry his daughter , and was promptly shot down . It was just no good for the daughter of such a wealthy family to marry one so poor . Nicholas told Annalette of her fathers answer and she began to cry . While wiping Annalettes tears Nicholas told her of his plan . He would head out and finally get recognized for his skills . he would then amass a fortune using his newfound fame so that he could get her fathers blessing . Depressed at the thought of her love leaving her for so long , but trusting him fully , Annalette agreed to the plan . So Nicholas headed out to make his way . He played everywhere he could . He saved every bit of money he earned but he was still getting nowhere . then one day , as he was playing , he was approached by Antonio Stradivari , the famed instrument crafter . Antonio had heard the passion with which Nicholas played his violin , and said he wanted to give Nicholas a violin worthy of such passion . Nicholas , flabbergasted , accepted this generous gift . Word spread of the violinist who had played so passionately that THE Stradivari had given him a Violin . Over night Nicholas got more fame than he had in all his life . Everybody wanted the passionate Nicholas Molineux to play for them . Before long Nicholas had ammased a small fortune and felt he could finally return and gain the blessing he had set out to acquire . Annalettes father said yes this time and Nicholas happily married Annalette . The World went crazy for the talented couple . They were the brad-gelina of their time . Pretty soon came the first baby . Nicholas Molineux II . Then a year later another , Annabeth Molineux . Then another year later twins , Edward and Edmund Molineux ! then a few years later the last was born . Geoffrey Molineux . At the age of 9 it was discovered that Nick the 2nd was a virtuoso on the trumpet . Then Annabeth , at the age of nine , was discovered to be a virtuoso celloist . The twins turned nine and were found to be virtuosos on the tuba and trombone . By this point everybody knows and loves the Molineux family . They traveled around and played as a family and sold out every show , so when the time came for Geoffrey to Turn 9 the world was abuzz . Everyone wanted to know what instrument the last child played . The big day is here , Geoffrey turns nine and he ca n't wait to find his instrument . Nicholas and Annalette take him to an Instrument shop and tell him to try everything . so he tries the trumpet , aaaand sucks at it . His parents encourage him to try another so he picks up a clarinet , and cant play it either . So it goes for the rest of the day , he tries everything from the clavier to the didgeridoo and sucks at every last one . In desperation Nicholas goes to Antonio and asks him to make a special woodblock for Geoffrey , a Stradivarius woodblock . Antonio agrees and begins to work . A month later Nicholas finally is able to give Geoffrey his new woodblock . Geoffrey loves it . He plays the thing every waking moment , and is extremely talented with it , at least as talented as one can be on woodblock , so Nicholas asks one of the top Composers of the time to write an overture . An overture for woodblock . He accepts and begins to work on it , meanwhile word has spread of the boys talent and the piece that 's being written for him . The big concert arrives . Its a stormy night but still the house is so packed that the coat closets are filled to the brim . It 's like heaven for a moth . Anyways , the concert begins . The crowd loves the piece and you can almost feel them rising and falling with the music . Then the time comes for the woodblock to finally be played . the music simmers down and then all becomes silent as Geoffrey pulls back his hand to play his woodblock . He brings down his mallet and it hits the Woodblock with a Sickening , awkward , and thoroughly unsatisfying , crack .

It's a little bit long, and it's the first novel I read. It's a big one, I'm going to read it again. I'm glad you liked it. I really liked the way it ties together characters and plot. I think the first book is a bit of a shame because it was so much like my first, and I don't think it had much to do with the rest of the story. It's one of the best books I've read, so I'm hoping I'll get to read it soon. Thanks!"}

It was bare ; I had only gotten the job about a week before school started . No time at all to decorate . That would make it all the better , y'see . Students would filter in to their American History class , bored , angsty , hopeless ... pencil-less . They 'd expect nothing short of , well , *nothing* from their new teacher . And then ... And *then ... * <newline> <newline> Oh , it made me giddy just to think about it . <newline> <newline> I slung my backpack onto the floor next to my chair and took a heavy seat .

I would like you to pull out a sheet of paper and a pencil for notes . We will be diving right in . '' <newline> <newline> The loud shuffling of paper overtook the room for a few moments .

His hand hovered over mine , unsure whether or not to take the pencil . He glanced up at me . <newline> <newline> `` Oh . '' I looked at the pencil in my hand pointedly . `` You would like two , would n't you ? Never hurts to be prepared .

Our former holy knight is trying to please the Dark Gods by doing really mundane things like littering and jaywalking .", "answer": "`` Oh , great and powerful Wazadin ! Hear me , see me , and be pleased with the sacrifice of this humble being ! '' Holy Paladin Derrick said , his hands high above his heads as he shouted to his Lord . He stood at the edge of the main road towards town , his silver armor glistening in the sunshine . Around him , a few patrons of the nearby city rode towards its great gates , ignoring the fallen Paladin . `` Take my sacrifice , and use the power it gives to smite your enemies ! '' <newline> <newline> Derrick took a few steps forward into the road , where a horsemen casually moved out of the way as he passed in front of him . He walked with his eyes shut , his hands at his side , and he took a step every few seconds . <newline> <newline> `` Oi ! Paladin , get out of the way . I 've got goods to trade . '' The horsemen said , his carriage of silk and cloth filled to the brim . <newline> <newline> `` A Paladin no longer , '' Derrick shouted , `` an acolyte of the Dark Lord Wazadin ! '' <newline> <newline> `` I do n't care what you are ! Move . '' The horsemen hit the reigns and began to push past the Paladin . He was struck by the side of the carriage and pushed into the ground . His silver armor now being covered with the dirt and mud of the ground . <newline> <newline> Derrick grunted as he pushed himself off the ground . He wiped the mud off the center of his chestplate and threw it onto the ground . `` Wazadin will punish the infidels such as you ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Sure he will ! '' <newline> <newline> Derrick wiped his hands off on the cloth hanging from his side . He used it to clean the rest of his chestplate off . An ordinary Paladin would have a sigil of a flaming sword , instead , Derrick 's plate had a sigil ( of which he painted on himself ) of Wazadin 's symbol , a red nine-pointed star . <newline> <newline> Once his chestplate was cleaned , he looked at the cloth in his hand . It was now muddy and worthless . He grinned , `` Great Wazadin ! Take this sacrifice of destruction and hate and give power to your Acolytes !

He smiled a big smile as he started to walk towards the city , intent on spreading his evil ways into the heart of the Holy Paladins . <newline> <newline> The trek was a short one , in which he shoved and pushed passed other patrons , each time shouting nonsense about Wazadin and being his acolyte . It was n't long before people were shouting at the Paladin , telling him to learn his manners and be a holy man . He laughed at each of them , and by the time he reached the gates , people had already heard about the `` arsehole Paladin . '' <newline> <newline> `` Derrick ! '' A voice yelled from within city . He looked around , trying to find the source of the voice . `` Is that you ? '' A hand slapped his shoulder and he turned to face the man . In front of him , was another Paladin , his flaming sword sigil still glowing strong on his place . It was one of his old friends , Trent , and the man who trained him . `` I thought you were dead !

Oi , that 's a funny joke D ! '' <newline> <newline> `` A joke ? '' Derrick hit his chestplate , smearing some of the paint off . `` It is no joke . The Paladins left me for dead and the Dark Lord rose me to fight his fight ! '' <newline> <newline> Trent looked around , seeing the people stare at Derrick and spit on the ground .

Before his hair grew white and his skin grew slack , the scars of battle fading with the relentless march of time . <newline> <newline> Still , Erik did not fear death . He knew it would bring him to Valhalla , and now , at the moment of his passing , he smiled as his final breath rattled from his body . Then all was light and ether . <newline> <newline> Erik awoke , if it could be called that . I truth , it was to normal waking what normal waking was to sleep . His senses sang in terrible harmony , his mind filled with a degree of perception greater than any he had ever imagined . He clutched at his head , his eyes bulging , slack jawed , his thoughts crushed by the overwhelming force of all eternity bearing down on him . <newline> <newline> Erik knew only one thing in that moment : He had never bowed to any foe , and if that foe was the cosmos itself , he would face it standing . <newline> <newline> With a scream of effort , Erik martialled his body . His legs . He needed his legs . He managed to roll onto his knees and plant one foot . Every moment of time , both past and yet to come , was howling around his ears in a silent maelstrom , colours undreamt of by human eyes danced like flames before him . <newline> <newline> With a grunt , Erik Svensson , breaker of bones , stood up . <newline> <newline> The madness stopped . The kaleidoscopic colours froze in place and faded , the whirling aeons paused , and Erik became aware of grass under his feet . He looked down and noticed for the first time that his body was as it had been in his prime , hard and strong . He looked up and found himself in a misty field , alone . There was an eerie silence , and a sense of dreadful stillness . There was no mistaking that this , indeed , was death . <newline> <newline> “ You are worthy. ” <newline> <newline> Erik whirled to face the voice behind him . He had been sure that there was nobody nearby , and his instincts were keen , yet a black-robed stranger stood behind him . The stranger ’ s robes were not of conventional material , coloured black . He seemed , rather , to be dressed in the utter absence of light itself . His face was mostly hidden , save for a lined and ancient jaw and eyes , deep in the darkness of his hood , that burned like coals . <newline> <newline> “ Who are you , stranger ? ” Erik demanded . The robed figure ignored his question . “ You are worthy , Erik Bonebreaker. ” The figure raised his voice and it echoed through the fog . “ A thousand thousand men have come before you , and been broken when faced with eternity . Only the strongest have the will to stand and fight in the face of the cosmos . You are one of the few , and have earned your place . Behold ! ” The figure raised his arms and the mists parted behind him to reveal an immense golden building . “ You may enter the Hall of Sacred Armament , that you might find the weapon that will lead you to your next quest… ” <newline> <newline> Before Erik could respond , the robed figure melted away like the mist and was gone . Erik looked at the huge building before him and began to climb the stairs . The doors at the top were made of iron and he heaved all of his mighty weight against them before they would swing silently inwards . Few mortal men would have the strength to enter such a place , Erik knew . <newline> <newline> Before him , the building was one enormous hall beneath a glass skylight , lined with weapons of every imaginable form . Some were affixed to the walls , others sat on oak tables , some were large enough to stand alone . Erik strode among their ranks , feeling something in his soul pulling him deeper into the hall . He paused at a gleaming hammer and knew in his heart that it was the legendary Mjolnir . Even Erik did not dare to touch it . To try to lift the Hammer of Thor was blasphemy . <newline> <newline> Elsewhere he saw many swords , some recognisable , others with strange , heathen shapes . There were clubs and cudgels , maces and morningstars , here and there strange metal tubes that he could not understand . He picked one up , experimentally . The tube seemed hollow , which would make it weak , and one end of it was of dark , polished wood . Clearly , a relic of some stupid and primitive people , Erik thought . A sensible weapon would have been the reverse ; a long wooden handle and the iron at the far end , the better to crush a skull with . <newline> <newline> He pressed on , unknown instinct drawing him towards a prize he had not yet found . He finally laid eyes on a table and knew , somehow , that this was what he sought , yet when he reached it , the table was bare . Erik", "pre": "......................"}

The story, which is a story of a young boy who gets caught in a similar situation, is very interesting, and I really enjoyed the book. It is very easy to understand and I found it very interesting. The story is very well written and the story is just a little too long, but I can understand why it would be an excellent book if the characters could have been more interesting and more interesting.

Suffice to say , it was hard and after receiving an ice pack and picking up a tooth off the ground , we all had a good laugh . <newline> <newline> Fastening my seat-belt and picking up a tape recorder , I hit `` play '' and put the recorder aside . <newline> <newline> I suppose you might be wondering why NASA would let someone who ca n't remember their seat belt pilot the maiden voyage behind a space craft in a televised event that the world will be watching . Well , the truth is <newline> <newline> 1 . It 's not that hard to pilot the Icarus . You see , they took care of everything for me , its near autonomous . All I have to do is a few systems checks and to start up the `` Ick '' is almost like starting a car . <newline> <newline> and 2 . It 's like that way for a reason . Easy like that . <newline> <newline> In the department the decision to take on someone new for the job was controversial . But outside NASA , the media Ate.It.Up . The headlines raved about it . Instead of the next American Idol , people were looking to see who would be America 's next top astronaut . The auditions themselves were held in sunny , Orlando , Florida . Not too far from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral . Hundreds flocked but I guess it helped that I got there early . It was n't too far of a drive from my parent 's spare bedroom in Daytona Beach . The networks loved interviewing me . A fuck up , or should i say `` reformed fuck-up '' . Who does n't love an underdog , right ? It 's like I could hide it when my occupation would read across the screen `` unemployed '' every time I went on Good Morning America , fuck you good morning America . <newline> <newline> But what set me apart from the competition is that I wanted it bad . Not that other people did n't , but what they were unprepared for is that I had been waiting for my 15 minutes for YEARS . I remember living out in L.A. and using the money I had to ask my parents for to pay rent . I remember eating cereal twice a day just to survive . All in the hopes that I would `` make it '' as a film maker . I did n't even need a career . I just needed SOMEthing . One piece , one big success and I could die happy , just to say I did it , that I really did it . I loved film so much , if I went my whole life without making one successful movie then I felt like I was a waste of a heartbeat . I would have starved for a big break . Not that I already was n't . I considered filming my decay for YouTube and uploading it . `` Man starves himself for 5 months '' , I could see it on the front page now . 15 million views , getting asked to speak on local news TV ... And I would do it too , oh I swear to God I would do it if only it did n't violate YouTube 's terms of services . Otherwise like most things in my life then , it would be for nothing ... I wonder why God would give me such a strong desire for film making but make me a fuck up . I used to tell myself the feeling was him right beside me ! Telling me not to give up ! But it 's hard to believe that after driving 5 days on gas you ca n't afford to make it back to your parent 's house because you ran out of money after 5 months in L.A even though you saved for a whole year working day and night as a waiter . <newline> <newline> However , regardless of my past , this was my time to shine . The largest audience I ever had at a screening was 58 . I counted . Now , this time around , the whole world would be watching . Mom and dad were so proud , my girlfriend Samantha was so proud . Everyone was happy that I finally found something to do with my life , like film was me trying to fit myself , a square , into a round hole per say . I might not have been good enough to get a real job , or `` make it '' , but let me tell you , I 'm not dumb . I was always a good student . Not a great student but a good one . In fact I was pretty good at maths and sciences , and that 's what got me here . I was in shape , I could do the monkey-work of calculating this and that ... and I knew", "pre": ".

While this is the mentality of every two year old , for me it was reality . If I wanted something , it would find a way to become lost .

By the time I was ten , I was considered to be the stupid kid , because I could never pass a test in school and was always making false claims . I dropped out by thirteen , and while I told myself my parents had my back , I was on the streets the moment I hit eighteen . <newline> <newline> That 's where one of my stories ends , and the other begins . <newline> <newline> I had a hypothesis , of course : *I am always wrong* .

{"question": "As an immortal , you strive to do something new each day . Today that thing is murder !", "answer": "If eternal life and invincibility were the boons of immortality , boredom was the curse . Or at least one of the curses . Kara had learned that lesson well over the course of a century or two . She was still perfectly healthy , as perfect as she ’ d always been , but the flame of life had begun to sputter . So she ’ d made a promise to herself to try something new every day . And today ’ s agenda was murder . <newline> <newline> Kara stalked through city streets lit by a half moon . The knife sheathed at her waist felt odd and heavy . Of course she had ample experience with weapons thanks to her longevity , but modern society lessened the need to carry personal arms all the time . She ’ d considered using a gun , but then she figured it ’ d be more meaningful to do the deed up close . <newline> <newline> Another woman , tall with fire red hair , was walking alone a few blocks down . A perfect target . As she walked toward the woman , Kara wondered if she could really do this . Really take another life in cold blood . She thought her heart would be racing , but the rhythm in her chest remained as calm as it had been for the past few decades . Her previous daily ventures hadn ’ t affected it much either . All she wanted was to feel a rush . Some excitement . But was she ready to literally kill for it ? <newline> <newline> As Kara closed in , the redhead turned to look at her .

Something spurred Kara to follow . <newline> <newline> The three attackers had the target cornered in an alleyway . “ Don ’ t get the wrong idea , miss , ” one of them growled . “ We ain ’ t gon na rob you or do anything dirty .

She felt at the cold steel of the blade that she didn ’ t even remember unsheathing . <newline> <newline> “ No… ” she answered herself aloud . Too loud .

She caught the bullet and tossed it aside , earning a stuttered curse from the gunman . The third tried to stand in her way , but she bowled through him without much trouble . As the gunman tried to grab her , she dodged and slammed the back of his head . He dropped , unconscious , onto the third man . Kara turned to the lead attacker . He was still clawing at the knife that she ’ d thrown . She strode up to him , grabbed him , and slammed him against the wall . “ If I ever see you pulling this kind of shit again , ” she said in a calm voice , “ well , I ’ m sure you can imagine. ” Kara gave him the smallest of grins as she threw him to the ground . The man staggered to his feet and fled . <newline> <newline> The red-haired woman eyed the two unconscious men as she sidled up to Kara . “ I…thank you so", "pre": "No worries. \" I'm making a decision not to allow anyone to go through this scary situation. \" we've been waiting for this for a long time.

This is the only way to describe such a thing that is happening above us . Close to five billion people have been wiped away in this police action . in 2155 a fleet of ships appeared above every major city in the world in a blink of an eye . Every space agency around the globe had no incoming transmissions , No knowledge that anything was coming . Just a blink of an eye and thousands of ships appeared as if they were teleported to those exact coordinates . Then they just sat . All attempts of communication failed , Every attempt to access the ships via docking were rejected . We even attempted to cut our way through a hull of a ship . But none of our technology was even capable of even making a scratch in the hull of the ship . So we waited and waited until one day it finally happened . The doors opened a smaller vessel had lowered to the ground in New York city . The creature emerged from the vessel and everyone was in awe . For that the first time we meet an alien race they looked exactly like us . They were distinguishable differences though as they were an average of two feet taller , No hair , extended ears , and no clothing . The news coverage said something about how they were called the `` architects '' and how they were hear to protect us from an incoming threat . This put the worlds armies in a code red status . I remember this like it was yesterday . For once the worlds entire population was in peace . Every other matter that has ever encumbered mankind was no longer relevant . Some three weeks later another fleet of ships had arrived . But they were much different then the architects fleet . They made no attempt to communicate with us because as soon as they arrived . The battle had begun the architects and the unknowns had began fighting . Huge ships the size of cities being destroyed , Crumbling cities below them . Its now been less then a year since this happened . I have nothing left , The world has nothing left . We have been reduced to nothing . All in the name of protection . Some speculate that the two alien invaders were at war with one another and each thought they were attempting to take a planet with intelligent beings .

I will keep my promise to my men and I will make a statement to the world about the man who died.\" In this letter I am giving a tribute to the man who died on November 26, 2016. He was killed on the same day as the August 22nd battle against the Germans. I am very sorry to hear of the loss of the man who died on September 19th. I"}

After all, we do have a lot of time to just get up and do some things. We really do have some chores to do. Today, we have a family of four and then we have a new baby. We just have to go back to the basics. We have a little bit more time. We don't need to worry about the baby. We can just move. We have the space to move and move around, we have to have a lot of things for our little little life. We need to learn to be a little bit more focused. We can do this. We need to be aware of the challenges of life. The stress we have on our baby. We are not going to live forever. We are not going to be able to live our lives on the one person we love, but we will not be crazy. We are doing this right. We have to learn how to be a more family with him. So we have to do this. So I have been thinking about a little bit about the power of being a mother. We are doing a lot of work and we have all done well. We have been working together for a little bit longer. We are going to have a baby next year. We have been working hard together. We are going to be working for the children and the future. We have been going through some of the painful times. I think that is a good thing. We are going to make it okay. We are going to do something good and make it work for the rest of the year. We will do some good for our children and our families. We are going to make it so we are going to keep working hard and not having to worry about our kids. We have done everything to our children and we will be doing them a good job. We are going to keep working hard. We have been working hard all year and we want to be the best at what we do. We are going to be working hard all the time. We are going to do everything we can to make it work and keep it that way. We are going to have a lot of fun. We will be making time for ourselves. We have decided to continue with the lessons we are teaching"}
