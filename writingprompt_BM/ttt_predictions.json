    "target": "The wet marble floor pressed on his cheek like a thousand hands slapping his face frozen in time . Smattering piss of rain ignored his indignant mumblings . His eyes fluttered . Pins and needs ran from finger to shoulder as he pushed back against the floor , contorting his aching body into a cross legged position . Last night was bad . He gathered that . His routine dullness of though crept inwards from the edges of his mind toward the black mist that veiled his most recent memories . He struggled to recall whatever he could n't recall but only for a moment before he decided it probably was n't worth the effort . <newline> He glanced around the room for a few minutes before concluding that he probably did n't know where he was . His investigation was n't entirely fruitless , he discovered a mostly full bottle of vodka . It was cheap but would definitely get the job done . Taking a few swigs made it childishly easy to ignore that gigantic black cloud of fog blotting out whatever the hell he did before he woke up . <newline> There was a mirror in the room and for want of anything more interesting to study he gazed at himself . It was a game he 'd play with himself , glancing at the mirror and seeing if he could recognize the person looking back . If he did n't know better he 'd have guessed he was a very successful mattress salesman , or perhaps a bum who had managed to score some luck gambling . <newline> His face was portly and unshaven , in that limbo place where it had been too many days without being clean and too few days to become a beard . His stomach was round but firm , like a basketball stuffed under a shirt and then semi deflated . The hair was long and unruly , receding far into the past . But his eyes were the giveaway . Looking closely enough at them he could still see an intensity . It was n't the sharp kind he carried in his youth but rather like a rusted dagger . Still sharp enough to cut . <newline> `` DiCaprio . '' The curse rasped out of him in a choke . After all these years spent working on the hallmark channel and tv series based on mediocre movies he was still there . Despite his best efforts to bury himself under all of the alchol and drugs he was still in there . He thought for sure after the bankruptcy he 'd be done , but no that god damned rerelease of Titanic the royalties started pouring in and he could n't get rid of the money . Not even the live action version of the nut job could destroy him . <newline> Cursing he hurled the bottle at the mirror but his wet hands slipped and instead of a shattering crash there was only a thud as the bottle bounced off the dry wall and rolled on the floor . <newline> His rage thwarted by his impotence he slumped against the floor and finally noticed why there was rain coming into this room . <newline> <newline> The window was smashed . He looked at the bottle , confused . No , he had n't done that . At least not with the vodka . He looked back at the glass etched around the window sill and his eyes hung on the red that stained the jagged teeth . <newline> <newline> The headache crept back towards the front of his mind while the bloody glass pinned his eyes in place . What the fuck happened last night ?"

He was almost positive it was screaming . When he tried to move he felt an excruciating pain in his left side that caused him to cry out . His hand moved to it instinctively and found something protruding from the wound . It seemed to be a pipe of some kind . He attempted to pull it out but it was covered in blood making it slick . <newline> <newline> Levi 's ears began ringing and the sounds began to become clearer , it felt quite a bit like some one was driving needles into his eardrums . The sounds he was hearing were definitely screams and not just one person 's , a lot of people were screaming or yelling . There was some one close to him that was crying . He looked in the direction of the tears and seen his sister kneeling beside him , her hands covering her face . <newline> <newline> `` What happened Laur ? '' He was shocked at the sound that barely rasped out from between his lips . His sister 's hands jerked down and she stared down at Levi with a shocked look on her face . `` bu ... I tho ... you were n't breathing ! '' What started as a whisper ended in yell as she threw her self across her brother and began to sob anew . Levi cried out hoarsely but she did n't hear . She just continued to cling to him like a little girl that had just found her lost doll . <newline> <newline> He put one of his arms around her and scanned the room as much as he could . It looked like a warzone , like something out of one of the many shooters in his gaming collection . `` What the hell ? '' There were dead bodies everywhere , he recognized some of them . There were firefighters and EMT 's running around trying to find survivors in the rubble . Most of the screams were coming from survivors . <newline> <newline> He seemed to be laying on top of the bottom of a desk , and he was pretty sure the pipe sticking out of his side was a actually one of the legs . Then he spotted it lying about two feet from his right leg , a round section of desk about the size of a softball . On it was a round symbol with geometric shapes glowing with dark red embers and a dull tendril of smoke rising up from it . It all came back to him in rush . <newline> <newline> He drew that in his notebook . It was second period and his trig teacher had this monotonous voice that could put a crack head to sleep . Laurana caught him doodling and had thrown a pencil at him to scold him silently , which made him jerk as he was connecting the last line on his drawing . Then there was the light and the heat and lastly the dark . Did he do this ? What the hell was going on here ? <newline> <newline> A voice brought him out of his little flashback . `` Sir . Sir ? Sir ! '' it was a firefighter . `` I need you to stay still . You 're going to hear a loud noise from behind you . I need you stay calm . '' `` Kay . '' He just blew up his classroom with a piece of paper and a pencil and this guy wants him to stay calm . `` it 's going to cause this desk to vibrate a lot and your going to feel some pain but there is nothing that we can do about it . We will work as fast as possible . '' <newline> <newline> The sound of the saw kicking on was not near as bad as he had thought , but Levi was no where near ready for when it made contact with the leg of the desk . His cries of agony began to drown out the sound of everything around him until darkness overwhelmed him . <newline> <newline> *Sorry about my grammar it 's been a while since I have written anything also < < < first time poster so take it easy on me ; p"

    "target": "So this is where it had all led him . The sun rose beautifully over the cityscape , painting the clouds with its rays in pastel hues , colors changing as particles of light refracted and reflected , bouncing around the skies aimless and endless , purposeless , never to rest , and most of all unknowing of their own vain labors . <newline> <newline> Ray stepped over the guardrail and perched on the precipice of his 100-story lookout , pensive . Many things ran through his mind ; his shitty job , his hateful parents , the loss of his wife , the only person he 'd ever truly loved . But mostly he wondered how his reaper could have abandoned him so . <newline> <newline> To most people , a reaper was a curse : a constant reminder that death was always there , waiting . An undeniable proof that no one lives forever , and everyone will die sooner than they think . The closer it was , the sooner you would die . <newline> <newline> Despite society 's countless incredible technological achievements , they could never figure out how to separate themselves from death personified . This never stopped the rich and powerful from trying ; as their reapers got closer , no insane pitch from a fast-talking entrepreneur was too outlandish for the wealthy to throw their money at . They called them Death Profits : a play on words of both the money made from misfortune and the undeniable truth that their failures proved . The diamond guillotine , the snake oil supplements , the guided meditation and isolation , even the hyper-boosted trips to space ; nothing could rid a person of their reaper . <newline> <newline> Which is why Ray loved his . Where most saw a terrifying ghoul , Ray saw a comforting promise . A guarantee that he would not have to exist forever . When his wife was killed in the car crash , Ray had seen in the rearview his own eyes , his own fear reflected as his wife 's reaper came barreling in from behind . In just a moment he realized it all ; they were due a freak accident , a change of fate . And then , grotesquely , a smaller reaper , its ghostly feet beating a silent *pitter-patter* , arm outstretched as it struggled to keep up with its mother . <newline> <newline> His daughter in the back . She was being cooed at by her laughing mother , gurgling happily in her carseat , blissful in her unknowing . What could Ray do ? *WHAT COULD HE DO ? * A thousand thoughts crossed his mind . *Prevent it somehow . Change fate . Swerve off the road . Offer your life as collateral . Pray for their earthly salvation . Something , something ! * <newline> <newline> She looked to him , one last time . In that final moment . Her eyes met his , laughing creases changing to worry in slow motion as she saw the unbridled terror in his eyes , he could see everything , he knew as her mouth begin to move in formation of the question **he knew** , it was too late , too late , and he would never forget . He could see it now in his mind in perfect detail , wind streaming in the half-open window , playing lazily with that lock of hair that she could never keep tied back . Her lovely chest beneath her white sweater expanding ever so slightly , unfettered by the seatbelt she hated so much to wear . The hazel-flecked green of her questioning eyes in the light , the pupils contracting in turn as the sun flowed over one before the other . Her soft lips just beginning to form his name , asking him to protect her , save them , keep her safe : his wife , the mother of his child , his only love and the only thing he ever loved , *save us Ray , save our baby* and yet he failed her , just as with everything else , he failed her too and her would never forgive himself . <newline> <newline> *Remember , Ray . Memorize it . Remember what you did . Never forget . * <newline> <newline> Just before the impact he could not find his reaper . He knew what was coming and he did not want to live , without them there would be nothing to live for and he knew he could not save them and he wanted to die . But his reaper was not there . It was not there and then the impact came , his world ending in a great explosive conglomeration of crashing glass and screeching metal and shrieking twisting screaming tearing and then blood , theirs and his mixed up slick and smelling of iron and heat in the smoldering car . <newline> <newline> She had gone through the windshield . There was a gash above his head pouring blood but remarkably his limbs were intact and he crawled out of the overturned car to find her , cutting his hands and knees on the crystal shards that lay in a carpet around the vehicle . His ears were ringing . As he failed to stand , he realized he could hear the baby crying weakly . He tried the door but it would n't budge . He surrendered his broken hands and pulled with all his might , the glass cutting into his fingers and bleeding down and around the handle . Nothing . He was raising his elbow to smash it into the glass , and then felt a ghastly chill . <newline> <newline> It was passing through him . Her reaper . Bony arms outstretched , wisps of ethereal smoke trailing behind as it moved to fulfill its grotesque"

    "target": "I 've always had trouble deciding whether to help someone or not . I 'm always worried that I 'll be cumbersome while I help someone , so I tend to ignore the needs of others . It 's something that I 'm actively working on , and one of my main inspirations for improving my speed of assistance comes from this story that happened to me . <newline> <newline> I lived in Hong Kong back when I was a kid - out in the New Territories ( the 'rural ' area ) , and would take the bus home from school . The public transportation was and still is fantastic , so I was alone when I rode the double decker bus back home . When I got to the nearest station to my home , I began to walk towards the subway tunnel , which led to the pathway to my house . The path to my house was under this long canopy of trees , and was squeezed into a thin lane between the trees and a wall right behind the trees - basically you could only walk on this path . The path extended past this sort of village place , then went on towards a cul-de-sac . The cul-de-sac was where I lived , and took about an hour to get to . It was a long but nice walk . <newline> <newline> Unfortunately there were a lot of wild dogs around that area , and I had an almost pathological fear of dogs ( I think I was bitten by one when I was really young and I kept that fear ) . At that moment in time though I only ever heard the dogs ' barks ; at that moment I had never seen a wild dog . Today though , I spotted a dog lying on the pathway in front of me . First reaction was to be quiet and just step over it , since I did n't have enough space to go around . But when I actually got to the point of doing the act , I stopped . It was probably smarter to just wait for the dog to wake up and leave . So I turned around and began to walk back . But then I heard growling behind me . <newline> <newline> Somehow I had woken up the dog ( I think I stepped on it 's tail by accident ) , and it was mad at me . So , faced with the danger of being bitten , and with faded memories of other encounters with dogs rising up , I chose flight and began to run . Of course , my stubby legs could n't outrun the fully grown dog , and it caught up to me quickly . Realising the situation I was in , I decided to turn around and fight the dog . So I promptly tried to punch its nose with my right hand , but instead got it caught in the dog 's mouth . Fear of the dog was n't ruling me anymore , and I bit the dog back . Dog whimpers and runs away , but leaves me with a bleeding hand - and the possibility of a disease . It also hurt a lot and I was still an hour away from home . I was happy that my bag was safe and sound though . <newline> <newline> So I began to walk home . But about five to ten minutes after I began walking , I met a nanny ( they 're pretty common in Hong Kong ) . She had headgear , so she was from Indonesia . She was also pulling an empty little cart that was probably meant for groceries . When I walked up to her she made a gasping sound and began talking Cantonese to me . I was an expat 's child though and did n't understand . She then dropped her little trolley , and lifted me up in both of her arms . She stuttered out the words , `` Come with me , I have bandaids . '' I just nodded and let myself be carried off down the pathway . She lived in the village that the path passed by , and so only took a minute or so to reach . She brought me into her employer 's house and sat me down . She gave me a phone and motioned to call and said , `` Parents . '' Then she went into another room while I called my parents . <newline> <newline> I told my mom what happened , she sounded flustered and told me that she would come pick me up in her car . The nanny then came back from the room she was in and was holding some alcohol , some paper towels , and those long white , wrapping bandages . She wiped off the blood that caked my hand , and added a liberal amount of the medicinal alcohol . She honestly added too much in my opinion . It honestly stung more than the bite ... Anyways , she then wrapped those bandages around and told me to sit tight for my parents . My parents arrived , and I left . <newline> <newline> I guess some people might say everything the nanny did was expected , and that anyone would do such a thing . But she could have easily ignored me , and that 's what I probably would have done : I would think the person does n't want my help because that person is n't asking . The nanny 's speed of reaction , and her willingness to do all those medicinal acts will probably always be stuck in my mind . Even if what she did was minimal . She was just 'someone 's in trouble - > must help"

The picture of childish curiosity , his head thrown back to look up at the clouds and his soft voice called out the shapes his mind formed for him . I was lounging on the sun bed set up on the patio , reading the latest trashy paper back novel , I knew I should have kept a close eye on him however my mind was whisked away on romance and the pangs of lost loves that the novel inspired .

There was a sickening crunch and it was over , the life drained out of the snake 's coils , lifeless as a piece of string . <newline> <newline> I turned toward the body of my son with relief coursing though me , I had won !

His plea sounded again , this time crescendoing to a ear spilling scream . <newline> <newline> `` MUMMY !

Just keep moving ! ” <newline> <newline> Ryan turned and started to rush down another grimy maintenance corridor , his head spinning wildly this way and that looking for any sort of escape route . It had been far too long since we had blown the safe and grabbed the cash - we should have been long gone by now . Instead , we were still stuck here , pushing against locked door after locked door , trapped like rats in a cage . <newline> <newline> “ But… ” <newline> <newline> “ Shut up ! We are getting out of here and getting far away , and then you can pay those medical bills and your family will be cured , ok ?

Breaking into a run , I darted past him as fast as I could , reached the end of the corridor and pushed upon the door . A brief flicker of joy erupted inside of me as they opened to my touch . It was crushed almost instantly as my eyes took in in everything around me – the dazzling sunlight . The endless rows of police cars and flashing red and blue lights surrounding the building . And the dozens of police officers hidden behind them , guns raised , ready to fire at anything that appeared in their crosshairs . <newline> <newline> I did n't hear the shots get fired .

The force of the shots sent me spinning to the ground , my head cracking harshly off the concrete , a small puddle of crimson splattering down next to my body . <newline> <newline> “ MICHAEL ! ” <newline> <newline> Even through the pain I heard that shout , and my vision remained clear . I could see Ryan coming out the door , the mix of terror , grief and confusion etched so perfectly on to his face it looked as though it had been carved there . Then he too was struck by another volley of shots , blood starting to rush from his chest almost instantly . As I watched him also fall to the ground the realisation came to me so clearly , even though my thoughts were fading away – he had never known what he was doing . He was trying to help me and help my family , but not with a grand scheme or any sort of plan , just with his instincts and the desperate hope that everything would turn out ok. <newline> <newline> And that was the first of the three lies . The other two merely followed as a consequence - we were never going to get out of here . I was never going to be able to help my family . Guilt and sadness flooded through my dying body , but I was comforted by the fact I knew I had tried . I had not just let them die . As my vision blurred , I took in Ryan ’ s body one more time . I held no anger towards him and the lies he had told me – he had only tried to help . The choices I had made were my own , and even though they led to this , at least I had made them . I had tried to make things better . <newline> <newline> With this in mind , I closed my eyes , and made peace with God . <newline>"

    "target": "My name is Dr. Tel'Vara Troperras , and I will recount the tale of the Breach that changed our world . <newline> <newline> I remember when the Fourth Wall came down . I was in my living room , browsing people 's artistic creations on my 55 '' HDTV , when my screen became an infintitely long hallway , much like when you face two mirrors towards each other . From within came the sound of elephants , clashing of swords , and all manner of rainforest wildlife . <newline> <newline> I wisely jumped out of the way before they came out , destroying half my house . <newline> <newline> The most logical thing to do was alert my friends to this bloody awesome scene , and then call the insurance company and police . However , the network was being swamped ; everyone else was thinking the same thing , as it was happening in their living rooms as well ! <newline> <newline> Reports started coming in : people dressed in strange costumes , talking strange languages . There were mutated creatures and high-energy explosions throughout the globe , which were thankfully confined to sparsely-populated desert and mountainous regions . <newline> <newline> No one really put two and two together until they saw a wizard , with a lightning bolt for a scar , casting a thunderbolt in Trafalgar square . Or until a battallion of pointy-eared fair folk were found in a national park , speaking a foreign yet vaguely familiar language . <newline> <newline> Either there was a global convention , or the world of fiction merged with ours . <newline> <newline> The Breach has no physical form . There was no crater formed on impact , nor a collision trajectory viewable from space . Rather than coming from the outside , it seemed to have come from the inside , through the mediums we used to craft those worlds : books , pens , tablets , and even paintings were gates and keys . <newline> <newline> Half the world did n't know what to do . <newline> <newline> The other half , we of the younger generations , knew exactly what to do . <newline> <newline> Every creative writer and artist became an architect . With their tools at hand , they could summon forth fantastic creatures , and rearrange a piece of the world to their own image . Art and words became their spell circles and incantations . Brush and pen became their wands . <newline> <newline> We discovered that how big a person 's alterations could be was strongly dependent on their level of delusion and artistic ability . The more practical you were , the less power you had in this New World . Naturally , anyone who 's won the lottery , received an inheritance , or suddenly found themselves attractive can tell you what this 'll do to a person . <newline> <newline> War broke out . First it was between the Realists and the Dreamers , as they called themselves . The Realists quickly lost ground , and now live on reservations . Then there were fights between the Dreamers , divided by canon . OCs became mercenaries , their 'delusion field ' only extending to a small radius around their person . Those who subscribed to particular canons could form gestalts , and entire cities could congregate together to essentially change the laws , within a six mile radius , to suit the consensus . <newline> <newline> But though laws of physics can be changed , there is still a meta to metaphysics . The newest academic field is Fandom Physics , which analyses the large-scale phenomena that result when different canons collide . What happens if two cities have six-mile Delusion Fields , but are only three miles apart ? Will they cleanly integrate like most Modern stories do ? Or collide violently when you cross Final Fantasy and Dead or Alive ( Monty Oum has been elevated to patron deity of that region ) . <newline> <newline> And magic ! Vancian and Functional magic paradigms have mutually exclusive clauses . What does the hybrid look like ? <newline> <newline> This is truly an exciting time we live in . I hope I live long enough to record it !"

When you tell a man he has a day to live , and remind him he could have been a monster car driver if he had n't knocked that slut up in high school , more often then not , you end up with a wrecked truck and a dead man . Which is fine , insurance pays and you garnish the wages of his progeny for three generations . To outsiders , it just looks a little ... exploitative . <newline> <newline> It happens to everyone . You wake up drenched in sweat , with crystal clear knowledge of the totality of your failure . To some men , the heights they could have soared made recognizing this day nearly impossible . For many , the dream came with the depressing realization of how little they could have amounted to . But for those in the middle , those who cold yet conceive of a perfectly actualized life , the allure of this alternate reality consumed even the knowledge of their imminent demise . This combination of hope and myopia was the lifeblood of payday lenders for generations , it took them an embarrassingly long amount of time to tap this market . <newline> <newline> The applications were the prospectuses of lunatics , incapable of separating their life of booze sodden compromise from the cloistered life of work and neglect which lead to their best selves And at the bottom of each is the untidy scrawled signature of the approving manager .

Cash or an overpriced platinum card , it made no difference . Purchasing alone took hours , and many had stress induced coronaries or wrapped their business Porsches around a pole before lunchtime . The hardier souls remaining sometimes even had optimism sufficient to order business cards before they succumbed . <newline> <newline> Then came the collectors to inform the family their property was now forfeit . Complicating matters somewhat was the fact this was often the first the family had heard of their dearly departed for some time . Not many perfect lives contained imperfect families .

True . I thought to myself , Ghon was practically immortal , simply because he could regenerate from any wound , a handy trait to possess in our line of work . But the side effect was that to keep up this unbreakable defence , he was always hungry , and had to consume copious amounts of food , often at the expense of the Ministry that funded us . <newline> <newline> The conversation between my companions had always been savage and violent , to the extent they would often fight until they were exhausted , with no amount of intervention able to stop them once they began , you really did just have to let it take its course once that occurred .

Because just as they define a power , it is not uncommon to have that power never reappear , so in the end , there was no point . The powers that have never reappeared are what we call god-tier , as they are often incredibly powerful or useful . There have been only 7 recorded , with only 1 currently still being active . It belonged to the man who was the head of the Ministry , a man called Reqrestrius John , an imposing man standing 7f 5 , and with the incredible power to cancel , as in cancel anything he wanted , all he had to do was touch it , and it would vanish . with this power , he had ended all adversaries in their stance , and had brought peace to our world . But another power was quickly being considered as the 8th god-tier trait , the ability of complete mind , body and soul manipulation , and the one to possess this power , was yours truly . <newline> <newline> With this power , I would take Johns position and rule this world . i thought to myself <newline> <newline> <newline>"

Actually , I think the day before the lowest , because the lowest was the next morning . On the day I tried to die , I was really depressed . Clinically depressed , it 's called . Every thought I had revolved around what a terrible person I was , how I deserved to die , how I wanted it to just end . I would think briefly how much happier people would be when I was gone , but I realise now that I actually barely thought about other people at all . I was basically mad with pain and not thinking straight , even if the pain was emotional rather than physical . <newline> <newline> So I jumped in front of a train . It was n't even a decision , not really . I was trying to get to my doctor and I suddenly could n't face the idea of telling someone who had been so blank the last time , what was going through my head now . It was my only way out , but it just seemed impossibly hard , and there was n't any future that was worth having . And then the tube was on its way in and I was jumping before I 'd even decided what to do next . <newline> <newline> It was like being smacked really hard into a giant speaker . It did n't hurt , not at first . Just this THUMP . And then I landed , and I thought this is it , I 'll land on the rails or get sliced up . But I sort of rolled under the train for quite a long time . I could smell oil and metal more than anything . I do n't remember seeing the driver . I 'm really , really sorry about the driver . I just was n't thinking at all , not about anything . I did n't know I was going to jump . I definitely did n't go there to jump . <newline> <newline> And then I lay there for a really long time , and the physical pain started , and you know what ? I felt a lot better . I really hurt , physically , all over . It made the endless thoughts finally shut up for a while . I was thinking this is it , I am dying . I could n't smell any blood , or really feel anything either , other than that I was hurt . I was just lying there while people moved around , cleared the platform , rolled the train forward . <newline> <newline> The other passengers were really angry and upset . I could n't make out words , but they did n't sound happy . I should have gone for paracetamol , except I did n't actually plan to kill myself at all . It just sort of happened . Anyway , the lights came back on and I had police looking down at me . I was blinking in the lights and one of the men swore and then went and threw up . It really stank . Another man kneeled down and asked if I could hear him , and I said yes , and a woman was talking into her radio , but I could n't make it out . The police man told me not to move . And eventually paramedics came and put me in an ambulance . They made me not look at anything . All I could see was yellow blocks either side of my head , and this woman 's face , a paramedic , telling me I was going to be okay . I met her again later on and I did n't recognise her until she said hello , and then I burst out crying . It was really embarrassing , for all different reasons . <newline> <newline> Anyway , the rest is all in the news , if you want to look . I made a miracle recovery , and now you ca n't tell anything had ever happened . I did get to see a psychiatrist without a referral . Most people were really good about it . I just felt so awful about what I 'd done to everyone and how much time I 'd wasted . I got lots of post , but nobody would let me read most of it . I got a lot of hate mail and threats , and my parents got it too . Dad was shouting at me how I was ruining things for him and mum , how they were going to have to move and it was all my fault , and then some nurses came in and he left and I did n't see him again , or mum , or anyone really . Mum sent me a card , but I did n't reply and she did n't send another . <newline> <newline> Anyway , I was back on my feet with all my arms and legs and everything back after twenty four hours , and I thought fuck . I 'm back exactly where I was before . I got really high off the morphine until they realised what was going on and I could n't have any more , and I missed it . I missed not feeling anything and not giving a damn . And I spent a while in a loony bin , which was n't as bad as I thought it would be , even with all the nutters . It was mostly really boring .

    "target": "`` Here 's you lunch , Commander ! '' <newline> <newline> Said the security guard , tossing a tray full of grey paste into the nearby cell . The prisoner that resided lay upright on his bed , staring at the ceiling . Yet another Super Villain caught by a Super Hero . <newline> <newline> `` You 'll be wanting some sauce with that , am I right ! ? '' <newline> <newline> Yelled the guard as he waddled away down the corridor , laughing boisterously as he turned to meet his colleagues in the office/poker room . <newline> <newline> `` When I get outta here fatty , you 'll be eating those words '' <newline> Whispered Commander , sighing as he watched the grey gunk pulsate on the plastic tray . `` Food like that should never move '' he thought , `` and it especially should n't be doing that '' . He threw a nearby book at the tray hoping the food would scurry away to disgust some other poor soul , because he sure as hell was n't going to eat it . <newline> Suddenly the cell began to vibrate . The tray on the floor , the bed , the shelves , everything began to move and shake . The Commander covered his eyes as sparks began to flash in the middle of the cell , and a blinding light followed from an opening in thin air . The light grew brighter as the opening grew wider and a loud creaking noise followed , echoing down the corridor . The light subsided and a tall figure caped and clad in majestic armor , stepped out of the opening . A wave of his hand caused the creaking to start again , before thuddng as the opening closed itself . The figure stood up straight and his eyes glowed a bright blue through his helmet visor . <newline> <newline> `` Greetings fellow Villain ! '' Bellowed the strange figure , `` fear not , for I am your salvation ! '' <newline> <newline> The Commander stared in awe at this strange being who materialised before him , hundreds of questions flooding his mind , but no words could escape his mouth . <newline> <newline> `` I see you are in need of answers '' said the knight `` well I shall give you 3 questions so be quick about it , I have n't got all day '' <newline> <newline> The Commander snapped out of his trance began to stutter . <newline> <newline> `` Er -- erm well . I-I-I guess my first question is how the hell did you get in here ! ? '' Asked the Commander , now rising from his bed . <newline> `` Oh , I was n't expecting that question first , but very well ! '' Said the knight , holding out his armored hand to demonstrate . `` That was what I like to call my Doorway . I can create small doorways from one place to another '' he said , creating a small portal in the space above his palm , complete with creak and light , like a door opening into nothingness . `` I simply opened a door from my lair to here , and we 'll here I am . Please do not ask me how it 's done . I have neither the time nor the patience to explain the power to every villain I free '' <newline> <newline> `` Free ! ? '' Quizzed the Commander , his eyes widening in excitement <newline> <newline> `` Okay ! Second question ! That 's right , I 'm here to free you , you poor sad man ! '' The figure laughed , brushing aside his tattered cape and revealing a large leather-bound book . The book appeared to be old but upon close inspection , it was just made to look old . He opened the book and cleared his throat . `` Now then , you are The Con -- '' <newline> <newline> `` Wait wait wait , who the hell are you ? '' Interrupted the Commander <newline> <newline> `` Oh , okay then , third question it is . '' He answered closing the book again . I , dear boy , am the Keymaster ! Master of Locks ! Conjurer of Doors ! And the KEY to the victory of the Villains in this city ! '' He opened the book once more , this time equipping a pair of reading glasses in front of his visor , and reading from it nonchalantly . `` Ahem ! Now then , you are The Condiment Commander , correct ? You were attempting to rob a safety deposit bank on the 18th of July , exclaiming that the law would never , and I quote , Ketchup with you , when you were foiled by leader of the Solar Squadron : Final Flare . That right ? '' <newline> <newline> `` ... ... yes '' admitted The Condiment Commander , begrudgingly . <newline> <newline> `` Right then ! '' Said the Keymaster , slamming the book shut and taking his glasses off , `` well despite your below-average evil-doing success rate , and your ranking in the Villain 's guild database , I have a feeling that the villains of this city will still need your unique ... ... ... skills ? During the final face off with the heroes that plague this wretched place . Do n't you want to even the score with that Final Flare . This is your chance , boy ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Final face off ? Even the score ? The heck are you talking about ? '' Questioned The Commander <newline> <newline> `` I 'm sorry but all three questions have been answered , but do n't worry all will be explained once the villains have all gathered '' he waved"

All completely bonkers ! '' He softened after a moment and brought a hand up to stroke his beard . `` A few of them have gotten close though , '' he mused . `` It 's funny , really . Science gives me less and less places to hide , and so do the faithful , and they 're both wrong . '' He sighed a small chuckle and wistfully gazed out across the landscape . <newline> <newline> All of a sudden he seemed deep in thought , and I forgotten . I hesitated to break the silence , yet as I tried to remain patient I wondered awkwardly how long it might take until a god broke their own silence . It could be forever . On the other hand , I did n't appear to have anything else to do , or anywhere else to go . Truly , this is what being dead felt like . <newline> <newline> `` So , what 's your best guess then ? '' God spoke in the direction he gazed before turning to look back at me . `` I 'll tell you how close you get .

Or out of the world . Just give it your best , that 's all I ask . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ok , but wait . '' God raised his eyebrows indulgently , a small smile on his face . `` If everyone has always been wrong , does that mean that whatever answer I can come up with will be wrong too ? Is it possible to be right ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Not at all . People have described me before as being ineffable . Which , as the logic follows , means that I can , in fact , be effed . It 's just that no one has hit the nose yet . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ok , '' I mumbled , and tried to muster some confidence . Then I had another question . `` What about when people refer to you metaphorically , does that count ? '' <newline> <newline> `` If we 're thinking of the same thing then no . Much too vague . '' <newline> <newline> `` Ok . Interesting , '' I drew myself up , to convince myself more than He . `` So , if , if everyone has always been wrong about you , that would mean that you 're neither all-powerful nor not-all-powerful , and the same with your omniscience . You are not the Creator , nor do you comprise some essence of the universe , you do not represent truth or goodness , nor do you have any special covenant with man . Oh , wait , that means you did not make us in your image either . So why do I see you like that ? '' <newline> <newline> `` Ah , there 's a trick to that but I 'm not giving you any hints . '' <newline> <newline> `` Oh . Ah , you mean , you did not make us , someone else did . And they made us in your image . Which would explain Jesus not being your son either . '' <newline> <newline> `` Hm , you are clever . Go on . '' <newline> <newline> `` No , I think I 've got it . '' <newline> <newline> `` My my ! Slow starter but clearly not just a pretty face ! '' <newline> <newline> `` Well it all came together when I remembered Acts 17:25 , which says : **'Nor is He served by human hands , as though He needed anything , since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things . '** I mean the second part is clear enough , just look at the world as it is , it 's pretty miserable . But the first part would mean that you are served by us , and you do *need* something . So , taking everything else together , here 's my idea . '' <newline> <newline> `` Yes , I 'm listening . '' <newline> <newline> `` The Universe was created for you by someone else , and all of the things inside it as well . You were placed here , and left alone , which means that you are all-powerful here but that 's only relative because it 's your universe and whoever created it for you is actually more powerful but they 're not here . Furthermore , they gave you the Earth and humanity in your image and left you alone to care for us . You do n't have a covenant with us , but you are beholden to the one that put you here . My Lord , you are *doing time* ! '' <newline> <newline> God 's lips were pressed together in a grim expression , his eyes narrow and hooded . I hesitated to continue , but realised that really , I had nothing to lose . <newline> <newline> `` The universe is your prison . You have to take care of us , for how long I do n't know . Maybe forever , as long as forever lasts here"

LoNs are like celebrities . Everyone knows them . The LoNs love people too-they generally tend to love the whole world . It seems they love anything that they 're related to . Lots of people want to be freed from Death , and maybe Bodily Needs and a little bit of Gravity too , but no one can dare ask it . They 're too scared of what kind of reaction they might show when they know we sometimes do n't want to be connected . <newline> <newline> They say get along with your neighbors . Well , I 'm proud to say I do . I 'm good friends with Gravity-we get along , we enjoy each other 's prescence . I baked him cookies , he likes it , he shows me some cool tricks controlling Gravity as he will , and I like it . Gravity is pretty lenient , so he does n't mind letting your hand go-lightening your gravity-if it 's for a short while . He would never completely let go , and it 's only temporary , but floating *is* a lot of fun .

Death was right there , in all her glory ! She was just like what I heard . Fiery red hair , curvaceous body , shining green eyes . She was one attractive lady . I recalled learning that before LoNs took on the human form , Death was perceived as some skeleton , dressed in black and holding a scythe . I could n't understand how anyone could think that way . Death was full of love . She loved everyone , perhaps to the point where it was too much and she got possessive . But she was vibrant with love and confidence bordering on arrogance . How could anyone think Death would wear black ? I took a step towards her , wanting to talk . <newline> <newline> I then noticed that Death was n't just enjoying the party . She was having an argument with Life and Inertia . I hesitated , not wanting to get caught up in a fight . Too late , Death turned towards me with tears in her eyes . She told Life and Inertia , `` Let 's ask a human then . Let 's ask what *they* think ! '' . She then asked with remarkable force , `` Life and Inertia says that I should n't exist and no one likes me . They tell me I 'm a bother . Are n't they so mean ? How could they !

'' was all he said . <newline> <newline> `` Anything , Doc ? '' I said as he continued his efforts to blind me one eye at a time . <newline> <newline> `` Follow the light with your eyes . '' He took the little light , started at the edge of my vision on my right and moved the tiny light slowly to the left - a tiny Sun looking to illuminate a problem . Any problem . <newline> <newline> God , please let me have some problem with my eyes . <newline> <newline> When the little light reached the end of it 's day and came at last to as far as my eyes could go left , Dr Bint turned his tiny torch off and sat back in his chair . <newline> <newline> He stared at me over the half lenses of his reading glasses . He knew me well enough to know that I was deeply bothered by something . <newline> <newline> `` Nothing wrong with your eyes Paul . '' He said . <newline> <newline> *Well , that just means I 'm crazy then* , I thought . <newline> <newline> I heard his chair roll forward and then found a lolly pop placed into my open palm - I had n't even realised I had just sat and looked at them , my hands , after he 'd given me the all clear . Dr Bint always gave me a lolly pop after a check up . He 'd been my doctor since I was six . <newline> <newline> *Could be something wrong with my brain . Something neurological ? * I thought . <newline> <newline> The kindly old Doctor patted me on the knee and said `` Paul ? What 's the matter ? '' <newline> <newline> I looked up at him . He was wavy and blurred through the tears that filled my eyes , but I could still make out the tiny horns atop his head . <newline> <newline> Dr Malachi Bint was a short , grey bearded man , with half-lensed eyeglasses perpetually stuck half way down his thin beak-like nose . He was not a Satyr , a half man half goat , but that is what I saw him as now . <newline> <newline> Two tiny horns peaked out from his greying , dark , legoman like hair . Instead of pants he wore furry goats legs . On his feet were hooves , not shoes . His shirt with it 's rolled up sleeves and his gaudy horrible tie were the same as ever . <newline> <newline> `` It 's nothing , Doc . '' I stood up , shook his hand and walked out of his office before he could object . The waiting room of the small practice was filled with an encyclopaedia of mythology . A tiny gargoyle , maybe a little boy , complained to a large pile of rocks that he was bored . The rocks passed the boy a smart phone and said in an entirely too feminine voice for a pile of rubble : `` Please do n't waste all of Mummy 's battery . <newline> <newline> There were winged things , slug things , people with animal traits , and animals with people traits . <newline> <newline> I left the small building , a converted house , and walked with quick long steps to my car . As I pulled away I looked back into the building through the tall glass windows at it 's front and saw Dr Bint . He stood , his legs all furry with hair , in the doorway to his office , a look of concern on his face as he watched me drive away . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> I had awoken that day and started it like any other : a bowl of sugary cereal and a half hour of early morning TV . I watched the news these days . I did n't really care about global events , which I some times felt guilty about , but I was n't giving up the sugary cereal and had decided I needed to do something to at least act like I had lived my twenty eight years . So I kept the sugar and swapped out the cartoons . <newline> <newline> There was the same news team I always watched , spread out on couches to show how casual and friendly they were . They would laugh and joke . Apparently , behind the scenes , they all hated each other . <newline> <newline> That fact made the show almost worth watching . I had waited and waited for one of them to snap , live on camera . <newline> <newline> Instead , I had snapped . <newline> <newline> Where I had expected people on couches , I saw creatures . The sports guy was a horned and heavy bull like biped - a minotaur ? - and the lead female anchor was a mermaid , her scaly tail flopped in the cool dry studio air . <newline> <newline> Those are some good costumes . Why are n't they bringing them up ? They are *really* good costumes . <newline> <newline> These had been the thoughts that went through my head . <newline> <newline> When I had stepped outside to make my way to my office my neighbours had worn similar disguises as they drove off to work . I ran back inside . The mirror showed a confused human man . No animal parts . <newline> <newline> Then I went and saw Dr Bint . <newline> <newline> * * * <newline> <newline> My time with the doctor had been unfruitful and so I had come back home and gone"

She saw right through him , but he 'd asked for it and she did n't mind all that much . She had a paid vacation saved up at the office , so they did n't mind either . Together they stood on the platform wrapped in their scarves and their jackets , giggling giddily . Both of them were filled with anxiety , but with different kinds .

I almost considered not showing up , but as a broke kid with just a bachelor 's degree , I could n't look a gift horse in the mouth .

I 'd been told to go to the conference room , and of course I did n't know where that was . <newline> <newline> I was on my way to the front desk to ask when the elevator dinged open , catching my attention . A man stepped out , tall , handsome , stylish suit , and a pair of sleek black sunglasses . He took one look at me and stepped back in surprise . `` Michael ?

'' He looked down at his watch , his very expensive looking watch . `` Fifteen minutes . That 's the right way to start an interview . Follow me . '' <newline> <newline> I followed him down a series of hallways before finally entering a small conference room . Inside there was an oval shaped table with eight or so chairs surrounding it . `` Alright so , my name 's Eli , I 'll be conducting your interview today . '' He said as he pulled out a chair for me . `` You can go ahead and read through this packet , it 'll give you all the basic information of the job you 're interviewing for .

I folded up the metal clip with ease but found that the flap was glued shut , goddamnit . I worked at it for a second , being careful not to rip it . I finally managed to open it and let out a satisfied `` Aha . `` , but instantly there was a loud pop and smoke began to pour out of the envelope . `` What the fuck ! '' I shouted as I dropped the envelope on the table . <newline> <newline> More smoke continued to pour out of it as I backed away to the door . I tried the handle but found that it must have been locked from the outside . I rammed my shoulder against it , calling for help , as the room continued to fill with smoke , I was coughing violently , my lungs burning . I stopped for a moment , trying to catch my breath , when I noticed my vision going blurry . I held my hand up in front of my face and found I could barely make out my individual fingers . `` What the fuck . '' I mumbled as I slowly collapsed to my knees as my vision finally went , feeling delirious . I passed out . <newline> <newline> I felt something hard pressed around my mouth and nose . There was a steady beep coming from my left . I was propped up slightly , but laying down . Slowly I opened my eyes . I was nearly blinded by the white walls and bright lights that surrounded me , but almost instantly I felt my eyes adjust and make it bearable . `` You 're finally awake . About time kid . '' <newline> <newline> I turned my head to the right , finding Eli sitting in a chair against the , facing me . He 'd swapped out the suit for a set of doctor 's scrubs , but he still wore the black sunglasses and expensive watch . `` What did you do to me ?

'' <newline> <newline> Eli stood up and held a barber style mirror in front of me . `` See for yourself . '' <newline> <newline> I looked at my reflection and gasped in shock . My eyes . They looked almost like camera lenses . Gray and metallic throughout , a shiny black dot at the center , as I looked at them I could see them dilate , the center ring visibly rotating . `` My eyes . '' I whispered , barely able to overcome the shock . <newline> <newline> `` And that 's just the tip of the iceberg . '' Eli said , putting down the mirror . `` Of course you probably wo n't notice the rest of your upgrades until you 're back on your feet . '' <newline> <newline> `` Why did you do this to me ? '' I asked , suddenly angry . <newline> <newline> `` Because , '' Eli said , taking off his glasses . `` We need more people like us"

People were going on about their business , each with their own thoughts , each one indifferent to one another . Then they all stopped to look at the globe of light . Some of them looked at those closest to them , in search of an answer . Others just stared at globe , slowly growing to be the size of an automobile , then a bus , then finally a small home . The light dimmed and through it was a passage to ... somewhere else . The other side was packed with people , mostly peasants , just as confused as the people on our side . They looked at us , and we looked back a them . Then they came through . <newline> <newline> The news talked about it for weeks . It was definitely a portal , one that led to another world . The people , the ones who came through , were being exiled from their small town after the invasion from the army of a neighbouring kingdom . Most of them looked like us , and their DNA was extremely similar to ours , so much that we were deemed to compatible with them . We sent scouts on the other side , scientists and soldiers , to inspect the world beyond , to decide if it was a risk . <newline> <newline> *** <newline> <newline> `` Sir , the opportunity is too big to pass up '' , said the General while looking at the numbers floating on the big , wall-mounted screen . <newline> <newline> `` That world , it 's so similar to ours . And its population , even with the technology they possess , what they call 'magic ' , they 're a thousand years beyond us in so many fields '' . The Scientist was standing by the general on this . `` They have a world that is mostly unpopulated , rich of resources and materials that we have never even imagined before .

The General added . <newline> <newline> `` We do n't have to go to war , General . And we do n't know what the mutated ones can do '' . The Scientist was not pleased by the eagerness of the General , and neither was the President . <newline> <newline> `` General , we have sent an army away from a village , and unless we 're going to have to defend ourselves , we 're not going to take anything by force , '' the President stated starkly . `` Tell me about the mutated ones , Doctor '' . <newline> <newline> `` Well , the ones that came through , they call themselves mages , '' the Scientist said , `` I ...

    "target": "( excerpt from Sid Meier 's `` Civilization '' , Volume 5 - 1850 to 2100 ) <newline> <newline> It was the period that the pitiful civilization of the French referred to as `` fin de siècle '' . Tensions remained high following the Zulu defeat of Pharaoh Ramesses , as India meanwhile swept up the last of the Babylonian resistance , but change was coming . <newline> <newline> In 1915 , Abraham Lincoln unexpectedly converted to Democracy . This sudden and drastic conversion shocked the world . Throughout the American Empire , from its seat of power in Washington DC , east to London on the British Isles , south to Detroit on the southernmost tip of South America , and west to the plains of Siberia , citizens were tired of endless war . <newline> <newline> Perhaps no one benefited more from this change in government than the Romans . In the stronghold of Caesarea , where a single militia unit had desperately held off the American siege for almost a decade , there was celebration in the streets . <newline> <newline> By 1945 , the so-called Pax Americana had spread around the world . In this year , the Chinese navy retired the last of its ancient triremes , while settlers completed civic improvements to railroad and irrigation around the cities of Paoting , Yangchow , and New City 1 . Meanwhile , Shanghai began construction of the United Nations . <newline> <newline> In 1965 , the Russians completed the Apollo Program , and within a decade had launched five structural components for an interstellar spacecraft . This triggered a space race , as the Russians , Americans , and Zulus scrambled to become the first civilization to reach Alpha Centauri . <newline> <newline> By the latter half of the 20th century , peace was the rule around the globe . Treaties existed between all major powers . Democracy was on the rise . Lincoln , Stalin , and Shaka were engaged in a friendly ( but heated ) rivalry to launch humans to another solar system , with the enthusiastic support of UN Commissioner Pravin Lal . It appeared that these civilizations had , at long last , built a peace that would stand the test of time . <newline> <newline> Everything changed , however , when Gandhi got the Bomb ."

    "target": "`` Dr. Edmunds , something interesting came up on the latest screen , '' stated Johannes , the tremor in his voice betraying a cautious optimism . <newline> <newline> `` This better be good . My grant proposal is due Friday , '' stated Edmunds , finally tearing her gaze away from the monitor and to Johannes . He quickly glanced at the ground , concealing his surprise . Edmunds appeared more pale and gaunt than usual . His face started to burn . Hardly anyone dared to enter Edmund 's office without scheduling an appointment . Luckily , Johannes ' appearance was bold enough to warrant her undivided attention . She noticed he was in an unusual state of disarray , hair greasy and biosafety suit wrinkled . He must have been working double shifts . <newline> <newline> `` I-If this is what I think it is , you 'll have every big pharma company coming to *you* with the money , '' Johannes replied . `` I repeated this experiment three times , always in triplicates . Data is statistically significant at a *p* of 0.0001 . In other words , there is a 0.01 % chance that it is due to random variation , and -- '' <newline> <newline> `` Let me see , '' she interrupted . Johannes passed her the sheets of data . Edmunds sat up straighter and leaned forward , brows knit in inquisitive concern as her eyes darted across the numbers . <newline> <newline> Sample 1215 : at long last , a positive hit . <newline> <newline> A rare smile slowly crept unto Edmund 's face , then suddenly burst into an ear-to-ear grin . Eyes shining , she said , `` We spent five years at the edge of this colony , hoping in vain to find some new compound as a therapeutic agent to combat the cancer on Earth ... . '' here , a hand flitted across her chest and rested across her heart . She coughed violently , spasms rocking her thin body as another hand covered her mouth . Pulling away , spots of blood were seen . She hastily wiped her hand off on a handkerchief . There were n't many unstained areas left on the fabric . The familiar dull throbbing pain returned to her chest . <newline> <newline> Johannes offered her water , which she gratefully sipped . After a pause , she continued . `` We took a risk being here . They said we could n't find anything by the mines . But that ended up being our advantage . What was Sample 1215 ? '' <newline> <newline> Johannes could no longer contain his once cautious excitement . `` Sample 1215 was one of few organic compounds found from the soil dug up in the mines . There is life down there , likely bacterial in origin , and it is producing this compound in great quantities . Mass spec data revealed a unique peptide sequence found nowhere on Earth , though there is some homology to *Micromonospora* soil bacterial proteins , '' he paused to take a breath -- oxygen content is lower inside the Mars facility compared to Earth . `` When given to cancer cells *in vitro* , it killed nearly all of them while not harming non-cancerous cells . In the animal model , this compound appears to stop angiogenesis . In other words , in addition to its cancer-specific cytotoxicity , it prevents blood vessel growth to the tumor . '' <newline> <newline> Edmunds slowly stood , smile unwavering . `` You have made a remarkable discovery , Johannes . You will finally be able to graduate with your Ph.D. , with nothing less than the highest honors . '' <newline> <newline> `` Thank you , Dr. Edmunds . Without your direction , this would n't have been possible , '' Johannes replied , bowing his head . A shadow crept over his face . There was a hesitating silence before he continued . `` I ... I knew about your condition all along . The cancer you tried to keep secret . The same cancer afflicting most of the population on Earth . The way you are now ... .There is n't much time . '' <newline> <newline> Edmunds nodded slowly in agreement . It was foolish of her to think the others would n't have noticed by now . <newline> <newline> `` I can give you the first treatment , '' Johannes said , looking up to meet Edmunds ' eyes . `` It might give you more time . Enough to see that we take it home over the years . '' <newline> <newline> Her eyes looked past Johannes towards the window , beyond the red terrain and into the sky . `` Yes , I would like that very much . But that ca n't be the focus now . I did n't tell anyone this , but there 's only going to be one more trip from the Colony to go home . Back on Earth , people have given up so much hope that they do n't want to allocate anymore resources to us . The grant I have been writing was for a separate project that can be done on Earth . '' <newline> <newline> `` What ? ! '' Johannes blurted loudly . `` There is only one chance to take home a cure we only discovered this month ? For all of the people affected on Earth ? How can we manage that ? '' <newline> <newline> Edmunds sighed . The weariness she felt was not only physical . `` What we will do is find the organism producing Compound 1215 , and find out the conditions it best grows in . Then , we will see if we can mimic those conditions on Earth . If we can grow the bacteria on Earth , we can produce"
